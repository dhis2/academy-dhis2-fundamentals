<h3>Introducing the DHIS2 Community of Practice (CoP) discussion forum</h3>

<p>The DHIS2 Community of Practice - or CoP - is a website where the global community of DHIS2 users connect, discuss, share and support each other through discussion forums organized by categories. We have created a specific category for DHIS2 Academy Courses where each of the DHIS2 Fundamentals courses has its own private space. By taking the Fundamentals courses, you are not only learning about DHIS2 but becoming a part of our global community, which is why we encourage you to interact with other course participants on the CoP.</p>
<p>Each time we propose a discussion throughout the course, you will find an invitation link that will redirect you to the specific discussion topic on the CoP. The invitation link will give you access to the private space dedicated to the DHIS2 Fundamentals courses discussion forum. When you click the link, the CoP website will open in a new browser tab. If you already have a community account and are already signed in from a previous CoP session, you can continue directly to the course discussion forum. If you are not signed in you can sign in using your existing username and password. If you do not already have a community account, you will be prompted to create one. </p>
<h3>How to navigate to the course discussion forum?</h3>
<p>When you create your account, the first interaction with the CoP will be guided by a tour with basic instructions that will help you with using the platform. If you need more guidance, open this<a href="/static/General_Forum_Guidelines__intro_to_CoP_.pdf" target="_blank"> pdf file with specific instructions</a> on how to use the Fundamentals courses discussion forums.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the use of the discussion forums is an <strong>optional activity</strong> and is not graded.</p>
