1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,740
- In this video,

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,620
we will discuss the second DHIS2 building block.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,363
The data element.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,030
By now, you know that the data elements

5
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,870
define what is being represented

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,713
by a particular data value in the DHIS2 system.

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,280
Let&#39;s go back to our example,

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,580
positive malaria cases,

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,500
recorded in Namchala Health Center,

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,163
in October of 2020.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,070
The data element details what is being counted.

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,373
In this case, positive malaria cases.

13
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,850
We can conceptualize data elements as labels

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,080
or variables that describe

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,973
what a particular data value represents.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,380
Data elements often represent a count.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,710
For instance, total population,

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,490
individuals immunized with measles vaccine,

19
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,920
and available hospital beds,

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,060
are all examples of data elements

21
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,763
that contain numerical values.

22
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,500
Note the data elements are able to store

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,770
other value types too.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,460
Such as text,

25
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,050
Yes/no values

26
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,203
and others.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,880
An important feature of data elements,

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,563
is that they can be aggregated in various ways.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,760
The data elements captured in DHIS2

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,433
representing numerical values,

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,653
can be summed over time,

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,150
averaged over time,

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,113
such as from monthly to quarterly values,

34
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,210
and counted or aggregated,

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,250
up the organizational hierarchy

36
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,373
such as, from facility to district values.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,390
Data elements can also be disaggregated.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,860
While aggregation means adding things together,

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,690
to dissagregate something,

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,763
means to separate it into its component parts.

41
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,530
Age and sex are common examples of dissagregations

42
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,893
applied to data elements.

43
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,530
Here, we dissaggregated the data element,

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,360
malaria cases RDT positive,

45
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,630
by sex.

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,510
So that we can see the number of male and female cases

47
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,263
as separate values.

48
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,860
This type of data dissaggregation,

49
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,840
is very useful for data analysis,

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,520
because it can reveal if there are any differences

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,283
between sex groups.

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,350
Now, let&#39;s talk about indicators,

53
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,053
which are using DHIS2 data analysis.

54
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,060
What are indicators

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,770
and how do they differ from data elements?

56
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,770
While data elements are raw values that are collected,

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,053
indicators are values that are calculated.

58
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,170
To illustrate the difference,

59
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,700
an example of a data element,

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,040
would be a number of immunized individuals

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,530
while an indicator would be immunization coverage rate

62
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,433
that is calculated based on a defined formula.

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,360
The immunization coverage represents,

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,960
a percentage of individuals vaccinated,

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,630
captured as doses given in a target population

66
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,253
of all eligible persons.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,000
Here, the indicator is immunization coverage,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,770
while doses given and target population,

69
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,773
are both data elements in DHIS2.

70
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,520
Now, let&#39;s put all these elements together

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,573
in a mathematical formula.

72
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,900
In this formula, we can see that immunization coverage,

73
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,900
is calculated by dividing doses given, the numerator,

74
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,830
by the target population, the denominator,

75
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,730
and multiplied by a factor of 100 to get a percentage.

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,370
Similar formulas can be used for calculating

77
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,173
many other indicators in DHIS2.

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,970
These formulas consist of a numerator,

79
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,200
denominator,

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,633
and factor of some kind.

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,060
Indicator calculations can also give totals.

82
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,960
Such as the indicator,

83
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,290
number of confirmed cases of malaria.

84
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,380
It&#39;s calculated as the sum of the cases

85
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,320
diagnosed by various methods

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,420
such as RDT or Rapid Diagnostic Testing,

87
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,713
and microscopy.

88
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,330
Using indicators that are calculated with population data,

89
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,710
enables the comparison of health performance

90
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,120
across geographical areas

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,700
with different population sizes,

92
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,793
which is often more useful than comparing raw data.

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,800
In this table, we see both the data element values,

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,340
doses given,

95
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,410
and population,

96
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,920
and indicator values for coverage

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,093
in two districts with different populations sizes.

98
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,330
Comparing the two districts,

99
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,880
we can see that district A,

100
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,320
has a higher number of doses given

101
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,683
than district B.

102
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,880
But if we look at the coverage rate instead,

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,310
which takes the target population size into account

104
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,573
a different picture emerges.

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,840
District B has a coverage of 50%

106
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,003
while district A has only 30% coverage.

107
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,390
It means that district B has a better record

108
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,280
in immunizing their target population

109
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,040
despite having the lowest absolute

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,073
number of doses given.

111
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,410
Let&#39;s quickly review the main features

112
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,490
of data elements and indicators

113
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,330
and the differences between them.

114
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,860
Both data elements and indicators represent,

115
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,620
what is being measured.

116
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,380
Data elements represent collected data.

117
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,690
Usually a raw count,

118
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,690
such as confirmed cases of a disease,

119
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,600
population data,

120
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,270
or number of hospital beds.

121
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,030
On the other hand, indicators refer to values

122
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,530
that are not entered directly

123
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,530
but instead are calculated using two or more data elements.

124
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,460
The calculation includes a numerator,

125
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,690
denominator,

126
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,070
and a factor,

127
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,870
such as in the calculation of immunization coverage

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,750
or maternal mortality rate.

129
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,940
They can also be a total of multiple data elements

130
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,330
added together.

131
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,220
Like we saw when we discussed,

132
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,853
the number of confirmed malaria cases.

133
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,681
(upbeat music)
