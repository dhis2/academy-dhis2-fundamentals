00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,150
- [Narrator] One of the
most essential features

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,640
of DHIS2 is its capability to transform

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,260
and review the raw data users enter

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,260
into the platform into different
data visualization outputs.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,640
In this video, we will review examples

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,630
of how to visualize
data using Pivot tables,

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,080
Charts, Maps and Reports.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,793
Let's see how it works.

10
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,780
Let's say we are reviewing
child vaccination program

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,840
and want to know how
many children received

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,220
their tuberculosis vaccine or BCG dose

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,220
during the last 12 months in
each district of the country.

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,820
To get started select the Data
visualizer app within DHIS2.

15
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,510
From this app select Pivot
tables as the visualization type.

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,250
From the available drop down menus

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,960
first select the data you want to see.

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,473
In this example BCG doses given.

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,700
Then the timeframe of those data,

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,633
in this case, the last 12 months,

21
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,070
and the locations where
those data belong to,

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,100
for example all districts in the country.

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,740
If you want to change the layout

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,610
simply drag and drop the parameters

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,490
to rearrange the request.

26
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,540
In just a couple of clicks,
you are able to get a summary

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,970
of children immunized with BCG by district

28
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,170
Within the last 12 months.

29
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,033
You can save this pivot
table to use it later.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,083
What if you want to view
these data in a chart?

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,743
Simply select the type of
chart and rearrange the layout.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,450
If you are not sure about the
best type of chart to use,

33
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,570
you will find short descriptions

34
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,513
of each one to help you select
the best fit for your needs.

35
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,340
You can also visualize the data on a map

36
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,513
by selecting the map option
from the chart type menu.

37
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,710
You can add different
types of layers to the map

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,373
to add more information to the output.

39
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,280
All these examples show very simple uses

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,323
of the data visualization
tools available in DHIS2.

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,790
You can also create more complex outputs

42
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,440
using the same tools.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,840
For example, if you look at this chart

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,220
you will see that it shows
the overall performance

45
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,430
of delivering essential
vaccines per region

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,340
compared to an expected target.

47
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,450
And more importantly,

48
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,430
you can add descriptions
and interpretations

49
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,040
to these outputs based
on the data being shown.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,990
This allows you to
provide a bit more context

51
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,293
to the data that you are displaying.

52
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,770
You can give this output a name

53
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,790
and add a description that
explains what you are measuring.

54
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,790
For example, "if BCG
coverage is greater than 90%

55
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,170
that means that we should
sustain the efforts as they are."

56
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,940
Low coverage can be based

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,653
on many different factors
that we can explain here.

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,390
You can also add an interpretation based

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,260
on your analysis of the data shown.

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,260
For example, "in Cat
District EPI MR 2 is 52.2%.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,440
Have we checked to see

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,943
if there is an issue with
stock or service delivery?"

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Finally, DHIS2 provides
several reporting tools

64
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,370
through the Reports app.

65
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,200
For example, we can
use the Data Set Report

66
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,550
to obtain detailed information

67
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,320
about different aspects of
the immunization program

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,163
in a given health facility,
in a specific period.

69
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,520
In summary, we have seen how
to create different types

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,520
of outputs in DHIS2 based
on the data already entered.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,880
Pivot tables, charts
and maps can be created

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,210
in just a couple of clicks and a number

73
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,720
of report types are available
within the reports app.

74
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,330
We can also add
descriptions to the outputs

75
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,023
and interpretations based
on our analysis of the data.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,097
