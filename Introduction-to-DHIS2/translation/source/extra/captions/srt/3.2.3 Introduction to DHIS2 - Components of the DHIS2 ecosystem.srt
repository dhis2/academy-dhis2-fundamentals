1
00:00:01,053 --> 00:00:03,636
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:18,343
- [Instructor] DHIS2 isn't
just a piece of software.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,030
It is made up of applications, resources,

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,193
different organizations,
and most importantly people.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,830
So let's take a look
at how you can interact

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,653
with the different parts
of the DHIS2 ecosystem.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,770
Let's start with the research

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,730
of the health information systems program

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,317
at the university of Oslo, HISP UiO.

10
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:52,440
HISP was founded to strengthen
health information systems

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,343
in developing countries.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,470
To support this goal,
the group researches,

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,070
the broader ecosystem of
health information systems.

14
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,490
This includes their materials, people,

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,030
competencies, institutions, and practices.

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,440
You can get involved in a
HISP-led academic program

17
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,073
or take part in their
action research projects.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,160
The HISP UiO research program

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,860
also includes the DHIS2 design lab,

20
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,890
which explores how researchers
and practitioners working

21
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,600
within the DHIS2 software ecosystem

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,550
can facilitate the design
and innovation of tools

23
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,393
that provide value to
the work of end users.

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,900
In addition to HISP UiO,

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,970
there is a global network of HISP groups,

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,470
staffed and led by DHIS2 experts.

27
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,330
They provide implementation support,

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,460
assist with platform customization,

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,860
develop innovative solutions

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,260
and build capacity through
the DHIS2 academy program

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,613
and local training efforts.

32
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,060
As you get more involved with DHIS2,

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,290
you'll likely want to learn
more about what others are doing

34
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,280
with their implementations,

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,280
share details of your own implementation,

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,470
or just ask for help.

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,470
The DHIS2 Community of Practice
is the discussion platform

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,720
where you can interact
with other practitioners

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,143
and learn from each other.

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,520
As you start to use DHIS2,

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,950
you may want to check the functionality

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,410
of a particular application.

43
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,410
The DHIS2 documentation
contains detailed information

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,643
and implementation considerations
available for DHIS2.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,520
And it's written by a core
team of DHIS2 experts.

46
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,797
These guides are all
available at docs.dhis2.org.

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,660
As DHIS2 is open source,

48
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,210
you can find all of its
source code inside GitHub.

49
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,810
You can also find all of
the DHIS2 documentation

50
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,100
and you can help us improve it

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,253
by suggesting changes or additions.

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,810
Being a global public good means

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,780
that DHIS2 needs to be available

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,850
for users all over the world.

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,040
Translation of user interface elements

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,660
and messages for the core software,

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,620
including applications,
metadata and other elements

58
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,440
is the key part of DHIS2 localization.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,390
To facilitate a community-driven
global translation effort,

60
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,700
DHIS2 uses the Transifex platform.

61
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,804
You can view and contribute
to DHIS2 translations

62
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,887
and Transifex at translate.dhis2.org.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,350
If you want to develop your DHIS2 skills,

64
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,470
you can take a DHIS2 academy course.

65
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,270
The academy program includes both online

66
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,840
and in-person courses on both general

67
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,820
and specialized topics.

68
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,920
Attending an academy will
help build your skills

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,950
to support DHIS2 implementations

70
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,343
and allow you to interact
with DHIS2 experts.

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,290
If you want to explore DHIS2 features

72
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,440
and practice your skills,

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,653
you can try it out on a
demo version of DHIS2.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,047
You can find the latest
demo at play.dhis2.org.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,490
As you use DHIS2, you might find

76
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,220
that something does not
work as it is supposed to

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,400
or you might even think of a new feature.

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,620
In the DHIS2 Jira,

79
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,790
you can notify the
software development group

80
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,043
at HISP UiO and they will look into it.

81
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,210
If you are interested in
developing applications for DHIS2,

82
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,210
make sure you have a look at
the DHIS2 developer portal.

83
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,330
Here you will find the latest information

84
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,140
about DHIS2 application development tools,

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,433
tips and training events.

86
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,950
You can find links to all the parts

87
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,910
of the ecosystem directly on
the DHIS2 website, dhis2.org.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,740
The website acts as a hub

89
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,330
where you can find useful information

90
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,330
on the latest updates on DHIS2
including software downloads,

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,500
plus links to all of the
resources mentioned in this video.

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,520
You can also get all the latest updates

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,820
by signing out for the DHIS2 newsletter,

94
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,683
and by following DHIS2
on Twitter and Facebook.

95
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,700
Above all, DHIS2 is a community

96
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,810
driven project that has succeeded
through local innovation

97
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,660
and collaboration across
countries in the Global South.

98
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,240
There are many ways to get involved

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,360
whether you are a DHIS2 user, implementer,

100
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,040
developer or researcher.

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,450
Take a look around the DHIS2 ecosystem

102
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,133
and join the global community.

103
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,572
