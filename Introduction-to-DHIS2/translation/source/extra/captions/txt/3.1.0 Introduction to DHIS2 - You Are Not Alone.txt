- I'm Khadija from HISP: Tanzania.

- My name is Zeferino Saugene, I'm from Mozambique.

- My name is John Lewis from HISP: Vietnam.

- My role is as a system analyst, but as well as a teachers to implement that.

- I am coordinating the team a foreign community that told us is Mozambique, which is also called and so Digitas.

- I'm a director now for his Vietnam leading the adjust to implementation in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands.

- I heard about DHIS2 when I was in my university studies, started engaging myself, went around asked about it, and at least they were cooperative enough, shared me the link, DHIS2 to fundamentals. And I started to learn more about it. And I would say everything started from there.

- I think started I getting involved with this group in 2003 in the master program. And then I went to Oslo in August, stayed there for one year. And then we come back to Mozambique and then I had one hour field work and then start writing and then finalize it in 2005.

- 2000 When I was interviewed for as a software developer to join his India project and one of the small constancy in India. So I was appointed as a system developer for DHIS21.

- As the DHIS2 team, we managed to support our ministry of health in implementing the DHIS2 country-wise and it's the key system that is used to by the minister of health in Tanzania in data collection and of course boarding.

- The DHIS, I'm a conference is the event where we, there is a lot of sharing experience, and then a lot of users, implementers, donors, they attend then we get there and then we share all our experience from the implementation side. And also from the user perspective.

- When we started HISP India I was the only person and then like three group to the national level for the entire country. I guess that that was the key event for me. We take a small NGO operating in a very small constancy in one particular village to move to the national entity and working with the Indian ministry of health.

- A lot, honestly speaking, because since I've started using it, or since I started knowing about it, it has proved to be a very very flexible platform. It was initially aimed just for health information systems. We managed to extend beyond healthy, but even using it in agriculture sector, as well as water. So I would say it's a very flexible platform and it can support a number of use cases. As we have had different use cases from different countries,

- HISP is a family we have been supporting many countries and then when I get to know several people they share the same challenges. For example, as in Mozambique, then we will, we go and we find that same challenge and you find that you will also find it in countries like the Guinea-Bissau or Sao Tome. So it has been to me it is a community., it's a family.

- For me, it's an ideology, which basically thinks about how best we can try to use informal system in the health settings and how best we can try to get the right tool to white people and DHIS2 what we believe is a tool which helps the health administrators and people to make a decision at the local level. And as well as the national level.
