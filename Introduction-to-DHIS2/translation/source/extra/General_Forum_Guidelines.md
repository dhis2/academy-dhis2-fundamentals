# General Forum Guidelines

## Do I need an invitation to join the discussion forum? (see invitation link at the end of this section)

Yes! To be able to join the DHIS2 Fundamentals discussion forums, you must use the invitation link to either login (if you already have a CoP account) or to sign up for a new community account.

Only after you have used the invitation link will you be able to join the course discussion forum with your instructors and peers.

When you click on the invitation link you will be directed to a signup page or login page. If you do not have a community account already, you can create one here. If you already have a community account, please click on “log in” to accept the invitation (see screenshot below).

If you sign up for the first time, you will see basic instructions that will help you with using the platform.

## Who is @discotbot?

While the platform is user friendly and you will be able to easily post and respond to posts, there’s a way to become more savvy in using the platform. @discobot is a bot with three tutorials (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to help you understand the technical ins and outs of posting, editing posts, sharing posts…etc but you are not required to complete those tutorials for this course.

## How can I find the discussion forum?

After you use the invitation link, you will be able to find the forum in the homepage. However, when you access the forum using the links from later modules of this course, if you are logged in to the community, you will be redirected to the related topic discussion.

## How is the discussion forum organized?

Each module has a specific pinned topic which is monitored by the instructors and course facilitators. When you use the links in the Module, you will be redirected to the related topic post.

In the topic page, you can “heart” posts, select text in a post to quote it, and you can either reply to a specific post or reply to the main topic post at the top of the discussion page by click on the reply icon under the post you’re replying to. Remember to bookmark posts that you find helpful, and if any post violates the [<ucommunity</u](https://community.dhis2.org/faq)

please flag the post for our community moderators. Please be polite to your fellow students. We want to build a positive, encouraging community!

Aside from the information listed, there are no silly questions and invalid opinions. Please feel free to post anything you feel is relevant in relation to your learning process or that of your peers, and make others feel free to do the same.
