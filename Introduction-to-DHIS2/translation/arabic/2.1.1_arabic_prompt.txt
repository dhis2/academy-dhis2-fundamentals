Hello ChatGPT. I need you to translate these caption into arabic. The context is health informatics :

1
00:00:01,015 --> 00:00:03,848
(uplifting music)

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,940
- [Instructor] In the
feature overview section,

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,640
you learned that DHIS2
is a web-based platform

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
offering tools for
collection, data validation,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,033
analysis, and presentation of data.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,290
But, how are data organized within DHIS2

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,533
to enable these capabilities?

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,800
In this video, we will take a look

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,600
at the three building
blocks, or data dimensions,

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,123
associated with all aggregate
data values in DHIS2.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,880
They are called, "data elements",

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,313
"organization units", and "periods".

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,540
These three data dimensions

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,690
are referred to as meta-data in DHIS2,

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,680
as they provide information we can use

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,023
to classify and organize the data.

17
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,023
Data elements represent
"what" is being measured,

18
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,230
org. units refers to "where"
the data were collected,

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,083
and periods represent
the "when" dimension.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,520
While data are routinely
entered using data entry apps,

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,713
these three dimensions are pre-defined.

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,720
Together, they provide relevant context

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,933
for the data to be understood.

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,843
Let's take a look at an example.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,070
If there is a data value of 39,

26
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,000
this value on its own does
not give us enough context.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,370
By attaching the what,
where, and when dimensions

28
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,893
to the value, we have a better
idea of what it represents.

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,710
Let's suppose that the value 39

30
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,280
represents the number of
positive malaria cases.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,100
This represents what is being measured,

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,360
the data element, or the "what" dimension.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,900
These cases were reported
in Namchala Health Center.

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,130
This constitutes the geographical frame,

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,440
the organization unit,
or the "where" dimension.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,070
And lastly, we need to add a timeframe.

37
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,600
In this case, October of 2020,

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,513
the period, or the "when" dimension.

39
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,080
You can see that when we attach

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,430
these three dimensions to the data value,

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,560
you can now understand
what that value represents.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,560
There were 39 cases of malaria
in Namchala Health Center

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,073
in October of 2020.

44
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,530
This approach to classifying
data separates DHIS2

45
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,210
from many of the traditional
health information software.

46
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,680
The fact that every
data value within DHIS2

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,070
consists of these three core dimensions,

48
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,160
independent of any particular source

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,070
or data collection form,

50
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,000
means that many different data sources

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,743
can be integrated into
one single DHIS2 database.

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,130
In summary, we learned that
each data value in DHIS2

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,460
will have at least these three dimensions

54
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,150
associated with it,

55
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,280
data element, the "what",
organization unit,

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,660
the "where", and period, the "when".

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,720
Together, they are considered meta-data,

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,360
because they provide
context to data values

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,870
and enable us to classify
and analyze the data,

60
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,110
as well as enable the integration of data

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,950
from various sources.
