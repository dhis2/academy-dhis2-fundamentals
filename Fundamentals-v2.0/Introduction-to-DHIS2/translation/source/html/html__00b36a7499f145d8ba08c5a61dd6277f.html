<p>In the last video of the series about DHIS2 building blocks, you will learn about the <strong>“When” dimension</strong> of DHIS2: <strong>Periods</strong>. Periods in DHIS2 refer to the time frame associated with data. You will learn the similarities and differences of how periods are used in <strong>data collection</strong>, where data are captured for a predefined period of time, and <strong>data analysis</strong>, where data can be viewed in either <strong>fixed</strong> or <strong>relative periods</strong> to produce different analytics outputs.</p>
