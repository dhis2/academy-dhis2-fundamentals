00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,810
- [Narrator] In a small village in Africa,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,660
a community health worker administers

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,513
a patient's first vaccination.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,310
In a remote settlement, treatment arrives

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,813
just as a disease
outbreak starts to spread.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,480
In rural Asia, a midwife
shares vital nutrition

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,880
and health information
with an expecting mother.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,130
In the Middle East, health workers provide

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,133
medical care in refugee camps.

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,880
Moments like these save
lives, but coordinating them

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,920
on a national or global
scale requires resources,

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,563
planning, and above all, information.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,360
How do you ensure the right
data's captured, analyzed,

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,091
and made available to inform
decisions that make an impact?

16
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:47,830
(music continues)

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,961
DHIS2 can help.

18
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,878
(orchestral music)

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,310
DHIS2 brings together
a wide variety of data

20
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,060
from a large number of
sources to one central system,

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,290
allowing for better planning,
information sharing,

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,070
and decision-making at all levels.

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,070
From the Minister of Health to regional

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,350
and district managers, to
medical workers in the field,

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,760
everyone can use this information

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,230
to make an impact on people's lives.

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,280
We'll show you how DHIS2
captures information

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,360
from even the most
remote offline locations,

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,480
as well as making it easier
to submit standard forms

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,310
and aggregate reports, and
you'll see how captured data is

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,040
reviewed, analyzed, and shared,

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,270
all from a single opensource platform.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,080
Let's see an example of DHIS2 in action.

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,480
The Ministry of Health has planned

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,400
a nationwide immunization campaign.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,290
At each community health
center across the country,

37
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,890
thousands of people will be vaccinated.

38
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,910
Before each center closes,
a community health worker

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,030
uses their tablet to
enter the doses given.

40
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,590
When internet is available,
the health worker's notified

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,430
and the data is sent to
the central DHIS2 database.

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,640
From her office in the city,
the regional health manager

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,020
can see, at a glance, how many
vaccines were administered

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,630
in each community and the
immunization rate for her region.

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,640
And at the Ministry of
Health, DHIS2 dashboards

46
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,840
measure the campaign's progress
and highlights any areas

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,690
of concern that need to be addressed.

48
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,710
Now let's see how DHIS2 can help respond

49
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,273
to disease outbreaks.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,950
A nationwide DHIS2 map shows
an increase in reported cases

51
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,660
of potentially deadly virus.

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,830
Health workers are dispatched
to the remote village

53
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,930
at the center of the outbreak,
but without internet access,

54
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,590
how will they be able to
transmit new data back

55
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,870
to update the national authorities?

56
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,160
With DHIS2, the emergency worker can count

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,810
how many households and
individuals are impacted

58
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,593
by the disease and send
the data directly by SMS.

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,630
At the Ministry of Health,
the emergency coordinator

60
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,360
can monitor the outbreak response
using her DHIS2 dashboard

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,963
and decide what followup actions to take.

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,770
In reality, there can
be millions of records

63
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,660
and thousands of datasets
being captured and sent

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,883
to a single DHIS2 database.

65
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,970
Paper forms have their limits.

66
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,680
DHIS2 makes it easy to
collect the same datasets

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,190
on Android phones and tablets,
and desktop computers,

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,790
and even submit limited data by SMS.

69
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,520
Data submitted to DHIS2 is instantly saved

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,200
and can be accessible
from any connected device.

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,660
DHIS2 provides data collection
in even the most remote

72
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,920
and fragile settings where internet

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,083
and electricity may not be reliable.

74
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,300
Making important decisions
does not only depend

75
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,590
on how fast data's available,
it also depends on the quality

76
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,730
of the information available.

77
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,500
DHIS2 has many data quality
features that help ensure

78
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,350
that data is accurate before
it's used to make a decision.

79
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,110
These include the
ability to validate data,

80
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,970
identify duplicate entries,

81
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,100
and flag abnormal values for review.

82
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,640
Managers can see an audit
trail of all entries

83
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,293
and changes and review summary reports.

84
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,060
Once data is validated,
it's ready to be analyzed.

85
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,120
Using DHIS2, teams can
make sense of the data

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,550
by creating visualizations
such as charts, tables

87
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,150
and maps, and use filters to drill down

88
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,540
to the most important information.

89
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,730
They can even create custom
dashboards that can be shared

90
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,953
with other team members for
discussion and decision-making.

91
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,334
(music ends)

92
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:44,780
Whether you're planning a
nationwide immunization program,

93
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,730
building your capacity to respond

94
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,453
to deadly disease outbreaks,

95
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,500
overseeing national and
international programs

96
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,420
for ongoing epidemics, or
managing a complex project that

97
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,703
relies on data-driven decisions,

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,250
DHIS2 is a free opensource
tool that can improve

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,560
your impact, helping you
collect, analyze, share,

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,112
and transform your data
into information for action.
