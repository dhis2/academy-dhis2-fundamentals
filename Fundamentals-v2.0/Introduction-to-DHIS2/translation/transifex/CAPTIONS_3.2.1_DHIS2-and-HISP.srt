00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:03,074
(lively music)

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,950
- [Instructor] It's
impossible to talk about DHIS2

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,563
without mentioning the HISP
program and HISP groups.

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,180
But what exactly is a HISP group

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,713
and how are they related to DHIS2?

6
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,313
In this video, we will
provide an overview.

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,020
Let's start with the original

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,730
Health Information Systems
Programme, or HISP,

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,570
which developed version one

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,570
of the DHIS software in
post-Apartheid South Africa in 1994

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,700
as a collaboration between
the University of Oslo

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,283
and the University of Western Cape.

13
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:59,460
HISP has since become a global movement

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,350
to strengthen health
information systems worldwide

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,350
as DHIS2 experts, many of whom
are former UiO PhD students

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,220
have gone on to found and lead HISP groups

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,893
in Africa, Asia and the Americas.

18
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,160
These HISP groups offer long-term support

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,840
to country governments
on DHIS2 implementation

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,240
and maintenance, provide capacity building

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,530
through the DHIS2 Academy program

22
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,308
and work with countries and organizations

23
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:39,520
to adapt DHIS2 systems

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,853
and create innovative
solutions to meet local needs.

25
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:48,460
HISP groups, together with HISP UiO,

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,970
form a global network of partners

27
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,160
that share common values,

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,950
including open-source principles,

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,250
local ownership, sustainability,

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,013
transparency and empowering data use.

31
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,360
While each group operates independently,

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,430
the HISP network as a whole collaborates

33
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,403
in a variety of ways.

34
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,300
In keeping with DHIS2's academic origins,

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,393
a primary area of HISP
collaboration is research.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,410
Working with the information
systems research group

37
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,150
at HISP UiO, HISP groups engage

38
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,380
in action research,
uncovering best practices

39
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,330
through targeted country interventions

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,110
and deep dives.

41
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,110
They assess and evaluate
country DHIS2 implementations,

42
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,300
explore new domains and challenges

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,100
and document their findings for input

44
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,233
into global products and strategies.

45
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,300
Another key area of collaboration

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,880
is the ongoing development
of the DHIS2 platform.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,100
While software development
is led by HISP UiO,

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,000
the HISP groups are the
most important source

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,260
of requirements for software
features and field testing

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,070
of DHIS2 releases due to their close work

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,210
with country governments.

52
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,120
Their input and feedback is essential

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,940
to ensuring that DHIS2 continues

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,523
to meet local needs and
function in local contexts.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,810
HISP groups are also a
source of local innovations,

56
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,090
such as custom applications,
metadata configurations,

57
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,170
and modifications to the core platform,

58
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,170
developed to rapidly solve
specific country challenges.

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,080
These local solutions are shared

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,960
throughout the network and can be adapted

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,350
by the core team at HISP
UiO for global deployment,

62
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,460
followed by iterative improvements based

63
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,390
on further feedback from HISP groups based

64
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,853
on real-world experiences.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,400
One example of a local innovation
becoming a global resource

66
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,770
was the HISP network's response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:21,080
A DHIS2 program for
port-of-entry screening

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,080
and contact tracing
developed by HISP Sri Lanka

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,240
became the basis for a metadata package

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,640
quickly deployed in almost 40 countries

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,163
for the COVID-19 response.

72
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,830
HISP groups also worked together

73
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,246
in regional hubs on national,

74
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:45,246
multi-country and regional
DHIS2 system architecture,

75
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,120
implementation, research and
capacity building projects

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,093
in collaboration with HISP UiO.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,950
In addition to this cycle of collaboration

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,440
between HISP groups in
the field and HISP UiO,

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,870
individual members from
various HISP groups also serve

80
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,210
as members of core DHIS2 teams

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,130
where they directly
contribute to development

82
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,620
of global metadata packages,

83
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,493
applications and training materials.

84
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,670
HISP, the Health Information
Systems Programme,

85
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,170
was the origin of the DHIS2 software

86
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,420
and HISP groups have
been the driving force

87
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,430
in developing DHIS2 from a local solution

88
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,270
into the world's largest

89
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,560
health information management system.

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,450
They provide long-term implementation

91
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,520
and maintenance support,

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,140
conduct capacity building,

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,360
perform information system
research and assessments,

94
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,550
provide input and feedback
on software releases,

95
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,860
develop and share local innovations,

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,860
and ensure that DHIS2
continues to meet local needs.

97
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,750
HISP groups are not just
a part of the DHIS2 story.

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,263
They are the foundation
of DHIS2's history.

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,903
Without HISP groups,
there would be no DHIS2.
