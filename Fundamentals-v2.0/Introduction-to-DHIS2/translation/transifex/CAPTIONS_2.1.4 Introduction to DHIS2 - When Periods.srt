00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,120
- [Instructor] In the
last video of the series

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
about DHIS2 building blocks,

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,323
we will discuss the "when"
dimension, the period.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,840
The period is a significant factor

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,120
when you are collecting data,

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,520
analyzing data over time

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,130
or creating periodic reports,

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,130
such as monthly, quarterly
or annual aggregated reports.

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's revisit our example
of new cases of malaria

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,923
reported in Namchala Health Center.

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,130
We see that those cases were reported

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,673
for the period of October of 2020.

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,920
That is a very simple example

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,573
of a period for aggregate data collection.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,380
In the context of data analysis in DHIS2,

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,710
periods can be combined in many ways

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,370
and how you use them depends very much

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,223
on the type of insight
you are looking for.

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,720
You can get aggregated numbers

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
for a specific period,

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,090
such as October of 2020,

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,433
month-to-month trend or annual trend.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,980
For example, we might be
interested in malaria data

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,520
for this facility displayed
monthly for the last year

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,413
to analyze trends.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,620
Or perhaps we are concerned

28
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,790
with yearly aggregate malaria data

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,003
for the period of 2016 to 2020.

30
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,930
"Yearly, 2016 to 2020"

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,680
and "monthly, last year"

32
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,173
are both examples of periods in DHIS2.

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,570
Notice that the first part,
"yearly" or "monthly",

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,380
refers to the frequency you would like

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,223
to display the data for.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,500
The second part, "last
year" or "2016 to 2020",

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,760
refers to the overall timeframe

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,863
for which you would like
to aggregate the data.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,240
For data analysis in DHIS2,

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,490
any period in DHIS2
will be some combination

41
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,293
of those two components,
frequency and timeframe.

42
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,520
For aggregate data,

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,120
the periods available for
you to analyze your data

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,400
are dependent upon the predefined period

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,320
in which your data are collected.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,040
This depends on the reporting schedule

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,400
of a given health program,

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,060
which may call for weekly,

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,003
monthly, quarterly or annual
reports, among others.

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,113
These periods can be configured
for all data collected.

51
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,850
For example, if the data
element, New malaria cases,

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,240
is collected monthly,

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,920
we can display these data for
each month it is collected

54
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,800
or we can sum these data
to show it by quarter,

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,033
six monthly, or yearly.

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,260
We would not be able to
show this monthly data

57
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,310
by week, however, as the
lowest level of collection

58
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,500
is by month.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,853
So it cannot be disaggregated any further.

60
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,050
DHIS2 supports two period types

61
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,513
when analyzing or reviewing your data:

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,623
fixed periods and relative periods.

63
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,810
October of 2020, or the years 2016 to 2020

64
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,820
are examples of fixed periods,

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,120
meaning they refer to a specific

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,563
and defined period of time.

67
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:35,140
DHIS2 also supports relative periods,

68
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,140
such as last year, last
month and this quarter.

69
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,940
These are defined in relation

70
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,143
to the date the analysis is carried out.

71
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,360
In some cases, fixed and
relative periods both refer

72
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,960
to the same period of time.

73
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,960
For example, if the current year is 2021,

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,260
then the fixed period, year 2020

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,610
and the relative period, last year,

76
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,293
both refer to the same period.

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,850
The key difference is that a fixed period

78
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,950
does not update automatically over time

79
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,360
for an analysis item,

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,100
whereas the relative period
will automatically update

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,480
with new data over time in relation

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,533
to the real-world date.

83
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,110
When creating analytical
resources within DHIS2,

84
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,663
it is possible to make
use of this functionality.

85
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,570
Relative periods can be useful

86
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,250
if you want to design a monthly report

87
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,080
that can be reused every month

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,520
without having to
manually change the report

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,723
to reset the period to the correct month.

90
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,380
In summary, we learned that the period

91
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,270
is the time dimension in DHIS2

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,760
for both data collection
and data analysis.

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,540
Periods within DHIS2 consist

94
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,110
of a combination of frequency,

95
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,320
such as monthly and yearly,

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,320
and a timeframe, such
as 2020, 2016 to 2020

97
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,823
and last six months.

98
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,000
The set frequency of the data collected

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,990
defines the lowest level of period detail

100
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,993
that can be performed in data analysis.

101
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,820
While aggregate data capture
uses only fixed periods,

102
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,400
in data analysis, two
types of periods are used:

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,253
fixed and relative.

104
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,010
Unlike fixed periods,

105
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,820
which do not update
automatically over time,

106
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,930
relative periods will update
automatically over time

107
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,443
based on the current date of analysis.

108
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:06,288
