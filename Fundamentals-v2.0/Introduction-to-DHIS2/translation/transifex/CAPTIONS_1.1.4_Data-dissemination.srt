00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:03,878
(bright upbeat music)

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,480
- [Instructor] So far,
we have seen how data

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,810
are captured in DHIS2

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,080
for aggregate events and tracker models,

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,083
and how those data are verified
to ensure data quality.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,260
We have also seen how
entered data are transformed

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,600
into different data visualization outputs,

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,960
such as pivot tables, charts, and maps,

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,300
and also how to obtain automatic reports

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,023
based on those data.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,310
In this video, we will see

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,150
how these different
outputs and other elements

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,900
can be put together in a Dashboard,

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,410
where all relevant information
about a given program

15
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,070
can be shown and shared with other users

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,143
to make dissemination of data easier.

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,610
Typically, when you first log in to DHIS2,

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,293
you see what we refer to as the Dashboard.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,090
The Dashboard is the page

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,920
where you will find a
collection of various outputs,

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
such as charts, maps and pivot
tables created within DHIS2.

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,700
You will find different
dashboards available

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,313
that you can move between
using the Dashboard Menu.

24
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,730
The dashboards that each user sees

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,850
are completely customizable,

26
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,770
and it's a very useful tool
to disseminate information

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,713
in a secured manner regarding
specific topics and outputs.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,660
For example, here, you can
see an immunization dashboard

29
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,820
that contains maps that show information

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,400
about vaccine coverage.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,050
Note that the intuitive color legend

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,750
immediately gives us information
about program performance

33
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,930
and identifies regions that perform well

34
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,380
compared to those that need improvement.

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,840
You can also take a map
and quickly convert it

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,420
to a chart or a table
directly in the dashboard.

37
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,560
This feature allows you to move

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,610
between charts, maps and tables

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,830
for any of the outputs
located on the dashboard.

40
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,860
If you want to open an
object in the dashboard

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,933
to further investigate the
data, you can do so easily.

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,340
The data that are shown
in a user's dashboard

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,910
depends on their own level of access.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,050
For example, a user with
permissions to view data

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,200
within an entire country

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
will see more aggregated
on a given dashboard

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,470
than another user who can only view data

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,483
from a single district.

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,700
You can also view the descriptions

50
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,570
and interpretations of the outputs

51
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,710
which help in describing
what the outputs represent.

52
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,740
If you want to make a comment
about those interpretations,

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,700
you can easily do so from the same page.

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,060
As you can see, this
feature makes it possible

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,070
to share findings among the
users within your system

56
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,620
and discuss further
actions to be implemented

57
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,240
This is one way DHIS2
allows you to transform data

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,193
into information that can
support decision-making.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,240
In summary, a dashboard
is a collection of outputs

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,410
that provides a summary of related topics

61
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,980
to be reviewed together.

62
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,340
They are very useful to
disseminate information

63
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,770
in a secured manner with other users

64
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,680
and can facilitate a
discussion of their analysis,

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
allowing for the sharing

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,300
of their interpretations of the data.

67
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,530
These discussions can support
the decision-making process

68
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,173
which is the final purpose of DHIS2,

69
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,073
transforming information into action.

70
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,505
