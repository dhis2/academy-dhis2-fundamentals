<h3>Discussion forum</h3>

<p>As we are reaching the end of the module, let's take some time to reflect on what you've learned and discuss the key concepts covered so far.

<p><a href="https://community.dhis2.org/invites/KLT3Dr3EQh" target="_blank">What is DHIS2 and how is it used?</a></p>
<p>Even though this is an optional activity, we strongly recommend you take some time to think about your new knowledge, read what other course participants think, and make connections with your own prior experience and current learning needs. This will help you reinforce what you have learned and prepare for the next module.</p>
