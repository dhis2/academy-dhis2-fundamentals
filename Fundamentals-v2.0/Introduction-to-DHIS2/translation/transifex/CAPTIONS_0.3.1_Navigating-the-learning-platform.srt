00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,070
- [Instructor] In this video,

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,830
we'll show you how to use the key features

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,420
of the DHIS2 online Academy platform.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,640
Once you've logged into the Academy

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,620
and selected your course,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,620
you'll be greeted with the course page.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,750
Right below the course title,

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,930
you'll see any messages
from the course team.

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,480
Then you will see the course menu

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
where you can click on a module

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,430
to view the subsections and units

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,320
or expand all to view the
outline of the entire course.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
You can start the course

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,210
by selecting a unit
from the course overview

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,030
or by selecting the start course button

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,830
in the top right corner.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,630
If you've already begun,

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,410
you'll instead see the
resume course button.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,030
Every time you log in,

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,510
you'll launch at the
subsection you were last in.

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,050
Once in, you'll have the
detailed course overview

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,260
on the left, next to the course material.

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,880
The blue underscored subsection
is where you currently are.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,490
You can move between the course content

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,190
using the previous and next buttons

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,250
at the top and bottom of the page.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,140
If you've completed a unit,

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
you'll see a green check mark.

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,290
To answer knowledge check
questions or graded quizzes,

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,390
you'll need to select the answer

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,580
and click the submit button.

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,790
When the show answer button is enabled,

34
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,850
you can click on it to
check the right answer.

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,100
At the very top of the page,

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,790
you'll find additional tabs
related to your course.

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,550
The most important is the progress tab

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,710
where you can check on
how you're getting on

39
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,060
through the course.

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,440
The FAQ tab is where you'll
find answers to common questions

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,640
about things like grading and
getting course certificates.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,550
Finally, you'll find
the participant's guide,

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,220
which gives a detailed
overview of the course

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,260
and practical information.

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,093
And that's it.

46
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,943
We hope you enjoy this
DHIS2 Academy course.
