00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:03,515
(bright music)

00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,240
- [Instructor] In the previous video,

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,900
you learned that any
data value in DHIS2 has

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,380
at least three dimensions
associated with it.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,893
The what, the where, and the when.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,330
In this video, we are going to talk

7
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,073
about the where dimension
or organization units.

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,903
What is an organization unit?

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,140
In simple terms, organization
units represent the location

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,840
or the larger geographical
context of the data.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,500
Examples of organization units
include a health facility,

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,410
school, location where
services are provided,

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,410
or an administrative unit
representing a geographical area,

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,523
such as a province or a region.

15
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,060
For example, in Lao, a country

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,060
whose Ministry of Health uses
DHIS2, the highest level,

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,523
or the root organization
unit, is the country.

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,900
The country is further
divided into 18 provinces.

19
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,900
And each of those is subdivided
into smaller districts.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,290
At the lowest level,

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,710
you will find individual health facilities

22
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,653
where the data are collected.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,030
Together, all of the organization units

24
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,283
form a hierarchical tree.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,360
In Lao's case, the
hierarchy has four levels

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,793
which correspond to the
administrative system.

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,390
The structure of the hierarchy,

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,520
including the number of
levels, is fully customizable

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,520
in DHIS2 to adapt to
each country's context.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,450
Organization units determine
where data can be captured

31
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,490
and how they can be
aggregated or disaggregated

32
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,563
within various reporting outputs.

33
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,700
For example, all data
entered at the facility level

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,990
could be aggregated to
provide a total value

35
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,073
for the entire district.

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,823
This principle is the same
as you move up the hierarchy.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,980
During the aggregation
process, data are added up

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,980
from the lower organization
unit levels to the higher ones.

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,563
DHIS2 performs these
calculations automatically.

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,450
Organization units also allow
you to display your data

41
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,780
in the DHIS2 Maps application

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,193
to better geographically
understand your data.

43
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:17,530
DHIS2 also allows classifying
organization units

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,680
by different criteria

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
other than the main
administrative hierarchy.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,430
We can do this by using
organization unit groups

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,483
and organization unit group sets.

48
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,340
An organization unit group allows

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,963
for additional subclassifications
of organization units.

50
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,790
For example, we can create
a parallel classification

51
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,930
of health facilities if
we group them by type,

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,623
such as district hospital
or field clinics;

53
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,563
by the form of ownership,
such as public or private;

54
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,483
or by location, such as urban or rural.

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,070
This is defined for each specific context

56
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,883
and will be different
from country to country.

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,800
Let's have a look at an example

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,233
of classification by the type of facility.

59
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,690
In this example, health
facilities are classified

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,780
and clustered by the range
of services they provide

61
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,800
into various organization unit groups.

62
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,730
These groups include
dispensary, health center,

63
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,113
specialist hospital,
and referral hospital.

64
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,040
The organization unit
group set is the name

65
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,270
for the umbrella classification

66
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,970
that these individual groups fall under.

67
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,473
In this example, the group
set is type of facility,

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,370
a category that contains the
organization unit groups,

69
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,713
which in turn each contains
specific facilities.

70
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,990
Organization unit groups and
group sets are quite useful

71
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,133
for disaggregating data in our analysis.

72
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,500
In this example, we disaggregated data

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,080
from malaria positive tests
by the type of facility

74
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,920
to see the trend for
each group separately,

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,350
and to compare monthly data
from each type of facility,

76
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,240
making it easier to uncover
potential variations

77
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,073
between them.

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,250
In summary, organization units provide

79
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,163
geographical context to data.

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,010
In DHIS2, organization units
are hierarchically related

81
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,270
to each other, with each level reflecting

82
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,053
the administrative system
of the country or region.

83
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,330
The organization unit hierarchy

84
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,150
also enables data aggregation.

85
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,280
Data that are collected
at the facility levels

86
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,720
are aggregated upward to higher
level administrative units,

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,853
like districts or regions.

88
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,570
DHIS2 also allows classifying
organization units

89
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,330
by different criteria,
such as facility type,

90
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,130
by using organization
unit groups and group sets

91
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,983
to facilitate more nuanced data analysis.

92
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,084
(gentle upbeat music)
