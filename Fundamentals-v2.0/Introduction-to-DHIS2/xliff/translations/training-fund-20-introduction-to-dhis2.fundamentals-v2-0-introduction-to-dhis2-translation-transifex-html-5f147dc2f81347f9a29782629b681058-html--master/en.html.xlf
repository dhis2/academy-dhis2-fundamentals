        <source>DHIS2 Use Cases: Applying DHIS2 to real-world problems</source>

        <source>&lt;strong&gt;DHIS2 use cases&lt;/strong&gt; are examples of the implementation of the generic DHIS2 software platform to meet specific real-world needs, from managing patient data at the health worker level to monitoring and evaluation at the national and international levels. DHIS2 use cases can be based on Aggregate, Event or Tracker data models, either individually or in combination with each other. These real-world examples &lt;strong&gt;offer great insight into the capabilities of DHIS2&lt;/strong&gt;, and enhance best practice and community learning, as countries and organizations can share details of their implementations with each other.</source>

        <source>In this section, you will learn how DHIS2 has been used in response to two of the world’s most pressing health challenges, COVID-19 and Malaria, as well as how DHIS2 has been deployed outside of the health sector to meet the monitoring and evaluation needs of Education systems. Through these use cases, you will learn about how DHIS2 is customizable according to each program’s and country’s context and needs, as well as get an &lt;strong&gt;introduction to DHIS2 metadata packages&lt;/strong&gt;, which help countries save time and align with global reporting standards through pre-set system configurations.</source>
