<h3>Discussion forum</h3>

<p>As we are reaching the end of the module, let's take some time to reflect on what you've learned and discuss the key concepts covered so far.
To do it, if you have already joined the course discussion forum, please click on the following link to join this specific discussion topic:</p>

<p>Even though this is an optional activity, we strongly recommend you take some time to think about your new knowledge, read what other course participants think, and make connections with your own prior experience and current learning needs.
