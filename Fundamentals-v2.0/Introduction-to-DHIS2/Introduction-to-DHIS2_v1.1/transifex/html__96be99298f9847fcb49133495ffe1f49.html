<h3>Where: Organisation Unit</h3>

<p>Now that you understand the basics of the three building blocks of DHIS2, let’s start looking at each of these building blocks in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>In this video, you will learn about the <strong>“Where” dimension</strong> of DHIS2: <strong>Organisation Units. Organisation Units represent the geographical dimension of the data</strong>. They define where data are <strong>captured</strong> and how they can be <strong>aggregated</strong> from a geographical/organisational perspective, such as aggregation from facility data to regional data, and from regional to national levels. You will also learn about alternative ways of grouping facilities using “<strong>organisation unit groups</strong>” and “<strong>organisation unit group sets</strong>”, which are useful in data analysis.</p>
