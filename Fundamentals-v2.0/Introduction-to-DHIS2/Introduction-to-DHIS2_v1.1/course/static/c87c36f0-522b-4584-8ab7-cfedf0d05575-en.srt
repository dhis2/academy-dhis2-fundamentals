1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,090
- If we want to make informed data-driven decisions

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,280
that have an impact on people,

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,310
we first need to understand

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,580
how those data are captured and verified.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,670
It&#39;s only when we have reliable data

6
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,780
that we can trust in our analysis

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,853
to support decision-making.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,383
In this video, you will see how data are entered into DHIS2.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,940
In the next video, you&#39;ll find out how DHIS2

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,633
helps to ensure data quality.

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,030
DHIS2 works as a centralized data warehouse

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,890
capable of capturing data

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,240
from a number of different sources and devices

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,100
including direct entry through the web or an Android device,

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,010
SMS, and even other data sources, such as spreadsheets

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,453
or other electronic systems.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,890
Within the DHIS2 platform,

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,460
there are several data collection tools

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,410
that we can use depending on the type of data

20
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,230
we want to capture.

21
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:25,230
We can distinguish three broad categories of data in DHIS2

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,270
also known as data models,

23
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,320
numerical or aggregate data,

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,490
anonymous individualized data,

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,070
and individual data with identifiers.

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,223
Let&#39;s briefly review each of these models.

27
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,380
The first data model is numerical or aggregate data.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,913
And we use the Data Entry app to capture data of this type.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,550
For example,

30
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,740
let&#39;s say 10 children received their vaccines today

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,760
in a given health facility

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,140
in the context of an immunization program,

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,723
and we want to enter this information into DHIS2.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,630
What are the steps we need to follow to enter these data?

35
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,733
Let&#39;s go to the platform and see how it works.

36
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,410
After logging in, go to the applications icon in DHIS2

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
and open the Data Entry app.

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,193
Then, use the search field to find the facility.

39
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,040
From the data set dropdown,

40
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,460
select the immunization program.

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,220
And finally, select the time period you want to update.

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,330
To enter the data, click on the data value cell

43
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,113
and enter the values.

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,650
Note that forms as well as the configuration and hierarchy

45
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,990
of the health system are completely customizable

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,660
within the platform.

47
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,533
This will be discussed further later on.

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,340
The second category of data or data model

49
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,520
captures anonymous individualized data

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,850
also called events.

51
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,023
And we use the Capture app to register event data.

52
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,040
For example, let&#39;s say we want to register

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,020
a new COVID-19 case in a given health facility.

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,170
What are the steps to enter these data in DHIS2?

55
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,973
Let&#39;s go back to the platform.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,110
To enter event data,

57
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,223
select the Capture app from the applications icon.

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,593
Then, search for the facility,

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,540
and select the event program.

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,300
In this case, COVID-19 Cases.

61
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,450
And then click on new event.

62
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,280
Once you fill out the form,

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,593
the data are stored in DHIS2.

64
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,630
Note that when entering events,

65
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,430
the data being captured are anonymous,

66
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,990
and follow-up on individual cases

67
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,713
is not possible within this model.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,650
The third type of data is individual data

69
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,760
with identifiers that can be tracked over time.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,450
This is also known as the tracker data model.

71
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,630
We use the Tracker Capture app

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,653
to register and enter this type of data.

73
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,160
Using this data model, it&#39;s possible to identify a person

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,840
by their name, phone number,

75
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,313
or a combination of any other identifiers.

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,860
We use this model when we want to follow up on individuals

77
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,840
to track their services

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,903
and perform individual level management of cases.

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,360
For example, let&#39;s say we want to register a patient

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,910
with COVID-19 to facilitate disease surveillance.

81
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,433
What steps will you need to follow to enter these data?

82
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,420
As in the previous examples,

83
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,810
go to the applications icon.

84
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,033
And in this case, open the Tracker Capture app.

85
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,103
Then, select the facility,

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,003
select the program,

87
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,590
and click on register.

88
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,220
The form contains data that identify the individuals

89
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,410
and track the services they receive.

90
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,640
To wrap up, there are three broad categories of data

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,840
or data models in DHIS2,

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,810
numerical or aggregate data,

93
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,840
anonymous individualized data

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,710
or events,

95
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,010
and individual data with identifiers

96
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,400
or the tracker data model.

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,680
And for each one, there is a specific entry tool;

98
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Data Entry for aggregate data, the Capture app for events,

99
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,153
and the Tracker Capture app for tracker data.
