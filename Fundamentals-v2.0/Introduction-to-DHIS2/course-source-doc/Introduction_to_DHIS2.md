1.2 How is DHIS2 used? (15 min)
-------------------------------

#### DHIS2 Use Cases: Applying DHIS2 to real-world problems

##### DHIS2 Use Cases: Applying DHIS2 to real-world problems

### DHIS2 Use Cases: Applying DHIS2 to real-world problems

**DHIS2 use cases** are examples of the implementation of the generic DHIS2 software platform to meet specific real-world needs, from managing patient data at the health worker level to monitoring and evaluation at the national and international levels. DHIS2 use cases can be based on Aggregate, Event or Tracker data models, either individually or in combination with each other. These real-world examples offer great insight into the capabilities of DHIS2, and enhance best practice and community learning, as countries and organizations can share details of their implementations with each other.

In this section, you will learn how DHIS2 has been used in response to two of the world's most pressing health challenges, COVID-19 and Malaria, as well as how DHIS2 has been deployed outside of the health sector to meet the monitoring and evaluation needs of Education systems. Through these use cases, you will learn about how DHIS2 is customizable according to each program's and country's context and needs, as well as get an introduction to DHIS2 metadata packages, which help countries save time and align with global reporting standards through pre-set system configurations.

#### Use Case: Fast-tracking COVID-19 response using DHIS2 metadata packages

##### Use Case: Fast-tracking COVID-19 response using DHIS2 metadata packages

### Use Case: Fast-tracking COVID-19 response using DHIS2 metadata packages

When the COVID-19 outbreak started in early 2020, more than 40 countries turned to DHIS2 to manage their data for various components of their COVID-19 response, including disease surveillance, port of entry screening, test result monitoring, and vaccination programs, with countries using aggregate, Event and Tracker data depending on their specific needs and capacity.

In this use case, we will focus on **COVID-19 Aggregate Weekly Surveillance,** and explain how the **data set**, **validation rules** and **dashboards** in DHIS2 function to capture weekly data needed for rapid response to disease transmission and provide key statistics related to COVID-19.

<img src="static/media/image16.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.45833in" />

The COVID-19 Aggregate Weekly Surveillance data set is a surveillance report that is used as a weekly data collection form filled out at the facility level (i.e. at a hospital, health center, etc.). The data set has six separate components, which are displayed in DHIS2 as **sections** of the data entry form:

1. New confirmed and probable cases

2. New confirmed and probable deaths

3. Health worker infection and death

4. Hospitalization and discharges

5. Tests conducted

6. Transmission classification

Each section of this form includes two or more fields. For example, **new confirmed and probable cases** has: 1) New confirmed cases and 2) New probable cases, both of which are **disaggregated** by age and sex. This means that the number of male, female and unknown sex cases are reported separately, within defined age categories, which allows for more granular analysis of these data. The other sections of this form collect aggregate data values without disaggregations applied.

All of these elements of the COVID-19 data set, including frequency and level of reporting and disaggregations, can be configured in DHIS2 to suit the local context. You can learn more about configuring DHIS2 for aggregate data in the DHIS2 Customization course.

<img src="static/media/image12.png" style="width:3.98387in;height:3.65104in" />

**Validation rules** allow you to run checks on the data that you have entered and stored in DHIS2. In this particular COVID-19 use case, the validation rules are scheduled to run weekly. These validation rules provide a straightforward data quality check before any analytic outputs are created from the collected data. You can learn more about validation rules for aggregate data in the DHIS2 Data Capture and Validation course.

<img src="static/media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.5in" />

This use case also includes a DHIS2 **dashboard** for analyzing and monitoring COVID-19 data. In DHIS2, once data has been collected, visualizations can be created for data analysis. Dashboards are a collection of visualizations and other outputs, enabling you to quickly find, share and analyze important outputs. In this use case, the dashboard includes a number of outputs, including charts, a pivot table and a map, which illustrate key data points, such as the number of cumulative tests conducted, cases reported, cases hospitalized, cases discharged and deaths. Users can adjust the settings on the dashboard to view outputs at various levels of the health system hierarchy, to facilitate analysis from the national to the facility level.

This COVID-19 use case is an example of a DHIS2 **metadata package**, which are installable, pre-built configurations of metadata (including data sets, indicators, validation rules, and dashboards, among other components) that can be downloaded and installed into any DHIS2 system.

Metadata packages are designed in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other subject matter experts, and are designed around global standards and guidelines for key health programs. Metadata packages also allow countries to fast-track their implementation of DHIS2 by starting from installable templates instead of a blank slate. Because of the flexibility of DHIS2, each metadata package can be further adapted and customized according to country requirements and context.

#### Use Case 2: Combating Malaria in Laos

##### Use Case 2: DHIS2 as a flexible platform to meet the national strategy needs from malaria reporting to malaria tracking for elimination

### Use Case 2: DHIS2 as a flexible platform to meet the national strategy needs from malaria reporting to malaria tracking for elimination

In this section, you will learn how DHIS2 was used for **malaria control and elimination programs** in Lao. This is an excellent use case to demonstrate **DHIS2's ability to evolve over time** as new data requirements and needs emerge. While this example focuses specifically on malaria data, the same processes and tools can apply to other types of programs managed in DHIS2.

<img src="static/media/image15.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.29167in" />

In 2016, Lao started using DHIS2 as a health information system for their national malaria program. This included adding their historical data–data they had previously collected –into DHIS2 using the **aggregate data model**. This data model was required since their data was numerical summaries of records. At the time, Lao was predominately collecting summaries of malaria records over the course of several years, as well as aggregate summaries of new cases reported on a monthly basis.

With DHIS2, Lao used customized tools within the platform to match the same format as their paper data collection forms, enabling their digital data collection forms to keep the same appearance and requirements outlined by the national malaria program. In addition, since DHIS2 includes built-in translation and localization support, these forms could be translated in the local Lao language for staff. Collecting this data using electronic forms in DHIS2 meant that it was immediately available for analysis using dashboards, charts, maps and other analytical outputs, instead of the time-consuming process of assembling these statistical outputs from data collected on paper forms.

<img src="static/media/image14.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.69444in" />

In 2018, health authorities in Lao decided to start tracking individual malaria cases over time, instead of simply collecting aggregate data on the number of cases. Through DHIS2, they were able to introduce the **tracker data model** for malaria elimination settings. In contrast to the aggregate model, this involves collecting detailed information on each individual case of malaria in these settings, and allows the individual cases to be monitored over time. This meant Lao was not only able to collect more malaria data, but more *detailed* malaria data, allowing for follow-up actions down to the patient-level, instead of just interventions based on analysis of regional and national trends.

In 2019, Lao decided to replace their aggregate data collection forms entirely and instead use the **event data model** for all positive malaria cases. In contrast to the tracker model, the event model is used to capture individual data points, but not to monitor individual cases over time. This meant that, for positive cases, no more numerical summary forms would need to be collected or tabulated, since event data can be aggregated automatically in DHIS2 according to the program's requirements. In addition, the source data became available for verification purposes at a more granular level than the aggregate model allows.

As Lao's malaria program adapted over the years, DHIS2 was fully capable to meet their data needs, adapting to changing requirements and additional complexity without the need to implement a new software system.

Several DHIS2 metadata packages for malaria are available to help countries deploy best-practice systems for malaria program management For more information on DHIS2 for malaria management, please visit the [<u>DHIS2 website</u>](https://dhis2.org/metadata-package-downloads#malaria).

#### Use Case 3: DHIS2 used as an integrated Education Management Information System

##### Use Case 3: DHIS2 used as an integrated Education Management Information System

### Use Case 3: DHIS2 used as an integrated Education Management Information System

While DHIS2 is most commonly used as an information system in the health sector, the platform is also used in other sectors like education. Ministries of Education use DHIS2 for school management, resource allocation, multi-sectoral analysis (e.g. health, education, nutrition, social protection) and more. In this section, you will learn how DHIS2 is used as an **Education Management Information System (EMIS)** in The Gambia to equip educational providers with data to improve school management, attendance and learning outcomes.

<img src="static/media/image8.png" style="width:5.92188in;height:2.30611in" />

Through DHIS2, The Gambia was able to set up essential **indicators** needed to manage various administrative functions within an education system. These indicators provide data on enrollment rates by grade, absenteeism rates for students and teachers, gender parity rates by school type, as well as various school infrastructure indicators such as, the number of classrooms, recreational facilities and textbooks by subject.

The Gambia used the **aggregate data model** in DHIS2 to collect and manage data for large-scale annual school census reports as well as the everyday operations of school attendance records. They replaced their paper-based annual school census form with a digital form in DHIS2, collecting various enrollment details for each school (e.g. the number of classes, enrollment by grade, with disaggregations for age and sex) as well as data on classrooms, overall facilities, water resources, and textbooks for students and teachers.

The Gambia also utilized DHIS2 to collect daily attendance records. In their case, they needed to collect attendance twice every day, as the number of students can fluctuate between morning and afternoon school shifts. The Gambia was able to rely on DHIS2 to meet their different needs regarding the frequency of data collection.

<img src="static/media/image5.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.97222in" />

In addition to DHIS2's data collection solutions, the platform enabled The Gambia to analyze and routinely monitor their educational data through various **dashboards**. For example, an attendance dashboard was created with data visualizations on absenteeism for students and teachers by school type. Using dashboards enabled education planners in The Gambia to quickly view data visualizations on attendance to understand trends or address any immediate concerns. Since the data in the visualizations are automatically updated as new data is entered in DHIS2, they can immediately analyze the most recent data.

The Gambia has also introduced additional data models into their implementation of DHIS2. This includes the use of the **tracker data model** for collecting more detailed information on both students and teachers. Using the tracker data model in DHIS2 allows The Gambia to follow the progress of individual students over time, for example to track their grades and subjects as they progress through their education.

DHIS2 provides countries like The Gambia with a flexible platform for data collection, reporting and analysis in the education sector, equipping Ministries of Education and institutions of learning with the data they need to make informed decisions regarding the management of schools, infrastructure and resources to improve learning outcomes.

- Indicator

### Video: What: Data Elements and Indicators

[<u>https://youtu.be/c4GVZ6z6YZw</u>](https://youtu.be/c4GVZ6z6YZw)

##### Knowledge check

**Question 1 (non-graded question)**

**Type** *(select and format bold)*: Multiple Choice / **Checkbox** / Dropdown / Numerical Input / Text input /Drag and Drop

Which of the following would be best classified as Data Elements in DHIS2? (Select 2 options)

1. **Number of available hospital beds**

2. Maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000)

3. Oral polio vaccine coverage

4. **Number of positive malaria cases**

Feedback: “Number of available hospital beds” and “Number of positive malaria cases” are considered Data Elements as they represent a simple count and can be collected directly. On the other hand, indicator values are not collected like the data element values, but are calculated based on defined formulas.

**Question 2 (non-graded question)**

**Type** *(select and format bold)*: Multiple Choice / **Checkbox** / Dropdown / Numerical Input / Text input /Drag and Drop

Which of the following statements about Indicators is true? (Select 2 options)

#### When: Periods

##### When: Periods

### When: Periods

In the last video of the series about DHIS2 building blocks, you will learn about the **“When” dimension** of DHIS: **Periods**. Periods in DHIS2 refer to the time frame associated with data. You will learn the similarities and differences of how periods are used in **data collection**, where data are captured for a predefined period of time, and **data analysis**, where data can be viewed in either **fixed** or **relative periods** to produce different analytics outputs.

### Key concepts

- Period

- Relative period

- Fixed period

##### Video: When: Periods

##### Knowledge check

**Question 1 (non-graded question)**

**Type** *(select and format bold)*: Multiple Choice / **Checkbox** / Dropdown / Numerical Input / Text input /Drag and Drop

Which of the following are examples of relative periods? (Select 3 options)

1. 2018

2. **Last month**

3. October 2020

4. **Last year**

5. **Last six months**

Feedback: Relative periods such as “last year”, “last month”, and “last six months,” are not defined in an absolute sense but rather in relation to the current date. The key difference between fixed and relative periods is that a fixed period does not update automatically over time for an analytic object; whereas a relative period will show new data as we move ahead with time.

2.2 What makes DHIS2 an open platform? (15 min)
-----------------------------------------------

Advantages of an open-source platform
-------------------------------------

##### DHIS2 as an open-source platform

### DHIS2 as an open-source platform

DHIS2 is developed and supported as a **global public good**. This means that any country, organization or institution can download and use it to collect and utilize data to improve public services. Essential to the DHIS2 design is the ability of the platform to be extended and modified to meet specific, local needs. To facilitate this, DHIS2 utilizes an open-source model to make the platform open and accessible by all.

### What does “open-source” mean?

DHIS2 is released as free and open software under the [**BSD 3-clause license**.](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) This means that the application can be used free of charge, anyone can access the source code, and the software can be modified and redistributed with few restrictions. This allows the global DHIS2 community to innovate and extend the software to meet local needs, and share these contributions globally.

HISP UiO also considers all supporting material that we produce in relation to the DHIS2 project (documentation, translations and training materials)to be open-source, and we make them freely available for local modification and use.

### The advantages of the open-source model

Offering DHIS2 as free and open-source means that anyone can download, configure and deploy it for as many users and devices as required, **at no cost for the software itself and with no licensing fees**. In comparison, proprietary software systems typically require the purchase of a license for each user. It is important to note, however, that while DHIS2 is free to download and use, it is not a fully out-of-the-box solution and will require additional configuration, planning, training, infrastructure and maintenance resources.

Another primary advantage of the DHIS2 code and data models being open is that it allows individuals and organizations **full access to the platform architecture.** This means individuals and organizations can more easily build custom applications to extend the functionality of their system, or link DHIS2 with other systems through interoperability solutions or metadata exchange. These local innovations and solutions can subsequently be integrated back into the DHIS2 source code, thus contributing to the greater good. Individuals and organizations also have the ability to modify and/or redistribute the core DHIS2 source code directly, with some limitations. However, this is relatively uncommon in practice, due to the complexities for long-term code maintenance.

While the core platform is developed by the University of Oslo, each implementation of DHIS2 (including configuration settings and the data contained within it) is **locally owned and controlled** by the organization responsible for the system. This allows members of the DHIS2 community to leverage global DHIS2 resources while also having their own, customized DHIS2 system, which they completely own and operate themselves.

Finally, there is a large **community** available to provide guidance on implementing DHIS2, as well as additional training and documentation that is available to support organizations in making DHIS2 work for them, all governed by open-source principles.

Open-source code also supports platform **security and stability.** External developers and security experts, who identify errors in functionality or security, can refer back to the source code to help determine the source of any issues they identify.

Integration with other platforms
--------------------------------

##### Interoperability between DHIS2 and other systems

### What is interoperability?

In a national health system, it is common to have several different information management platforms performing complementary functions alongside one another. These systems may need to exchange information—or “talk” to each other—in order for decision makers to obtain a broader, more detailed picture of what is happening in the health system as a whole. The ability to send and receive information between different systems, software and file formats is referred to as **interoperability**.

For example, DHIS2 and OpenMRS (**M**edical **R**ecords **S**ystem) are interoperable, because they allow the sharing of data and data definitions with each other. In this example, a health system may use OpenMRS to store detailed medical records for each individual hospital admission (among other hospital data). Meanwhile, the health system's DHIS2 implementation may only require the aggregate number of hospital admissions separated by various criteria. Interoperability allows DHIS2 to receive these totals from OpenMRS and use them for analysis in combination with other data stored in DHIS2. This is commonly referred to as a 1:1 integration, as you are linking one system directly to another.

### How does interoperability work?

Interoperability depends on standards for data formats, interfaces, codes and terminologies. In an ideal situation, these would be drawn from international standards.However, in most contexts, a mix of international and local standards are used. These standards can be broken down into two levels:

1. **Content:** Ensuring what is being shared between systems represents the same item conceptually

2. **Technical:** Involving the mechanism used to actually transmit the data from one system to the other

At the **content** level, consistency of definitions is required. This includes not just consistency of data element definitions, but also of their disaggregations. To return to our OpenMRS example, if the “hospital admissions” data element in DHIS2 did not include the required disaggregations from OpenMRS (such as age and sex), but instead defined admissions as a total value, this would result in difficulty sharing these data.

At the **technical** level, various data exchange standards can be adopted. One standard example for aggregate data is called ADX (**A**ggregate **D**ata e**X**change), which is used to share aggregate data across various systems, including DHIS2. Another commonly discussed standard is [<u>FHIR</u>](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) (**F**ast **H**ealthcare **I**nteroperability **R**esource). HISP and the DHIS2 community are actively involved in supporting the development and use of global standards such as these.

### Interoperability between DHIS2 and other systems

One of the most common DHIS2 interoperability scenarios is using DHIS2 as a **data warehouse**. This term describes how DHIS2 can be used to receive information from multiple information systems and sources to facilitate data triangulation. In this scenario, DHIS2 often acts as the standard for metadata that is shared across these connected systems, allowing for alignment of codes, definitions and IDs for the information being exchanged.

Let's look at an example of how specific ADX-compatible systems could be linked to DHIS2:

- [<u>iHRIS</u>](https://www.ihris.org/): A system for tracking and managing health workforce data

- [<u>OpenMRS</u>](https://openmrs.org/): A medical records system

- [<u>OpenELIS</u>](https://openelis-global.org/): A laboratory enterprise information system.

<img src="static/media/image13.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.63889in" />

As the diagram shows, iHRIS can send relevant data to DHIS2, such as the "number of doctors", "number of nurses" and "total number of staff”. OpenMRS is able to aggregate data on inpatient diseases and send the aggregated data to DHIS2. OpenELIS can generate data on the outcome of laboratory tests and send them to DHIS2. In this interoperable network, the DHIS2 application serves as an integrated data warehouse that hosts data from these various sources, where the data can be used on a national level to make informed decisions.

There are additional interoperability scenarios in which DHIS2 may play a smaller overall role. In these scenarios, instead of using DHIS2 to combine data from other systems, data in DHIS2 may be sent to other systems that require it. This can include national, global or regional systems that require information from DHIS2. For example, DHIS2 may send national disease surveillance data to a regional surveillance information system to facilitate cross-regional/border surveillance.

While these interoperability and data exchange models are achievable, in practice there are often many practical challenges. Many of the systems involved in exchanging information will face ongoing, dynamic developments over time; this can include changes to the content as well as software version revisions or technical updates. As a result, an exchange that is working at a certain point in time may not work as systems are developed further. Interoperability is a process that requires strong governance to coordinate content across systems, as well as technical skills that are available on an ongoing basis as systems are initially implemented and modified. For more information on interoperability concepts, please consult our [<u>documentation</u>](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/dhis2_implementation_guide/integration-concepts.html).

5. They allow for selecting a specific group or health facilities based on the data collected on them

Feedback: Organisation unit groups and organisation unit group sets allows for classifying Organization Units by criteria other than the main administrative hierarchy, such as type of ownership, type of facility etc. In analytics, they are useful for viewing data by group to see if trends differ (for example, private vs public health facilities).

**Question 10**

**Type** *(select and format bold)*: Multiple Choice / **Checkbox** / Dropdown / Numerical Input / Text input /Drag and Drop

Which of the following statements about Indicators is true: (Select 2 options)

1. They are raw data values

2. They are collected

3. **They are calculated values**

4. **They are often useful for comparison of health performance across geographical areas with very disparate target population sizes**

Feedback: Indicators refer to values that are not entered directly, but instead are calculated using one or more data elements.

**Question 11**

**Type** *(select and format bold)*: **Multiple Choice** / Checkbox / Dropdown / Numerical Input / Text input /Drag and Drop

Indicators are calculated using a formula that contains a numerator and denominator.

1. **True**

2. False

Feedback: In DHIS2, all indicators must have a numerator, denominator, and a multiplying factor. However, if the calculator is a total number, for example, “Total ANC visits” (ANC1 + ANC2 + ANC3 + ANC4), then the denominator and the multiplying factor would both be 1.

### Key milestones of DHIS2

Now that you have seen an overview of the history of DHIS2, now you can explore the key milestones in more detail. Click the play button below to get started. You can use the Next and Back buttons to navigate through the slides.

### 1994: HISP launches

DHIS2 began with the Health Information Systems Programme, known as HISP. HISP is a global action research network initiated jointly in 1994 by the University of Oslo and the University of Western Cape in South Africa. Its continued mission is to empower users at local levels to use their data for evidence-based decision making.

### 1996: DHIS launches

As a result of the HISP collaboration, the District Health Information Software, or DHIS, was launched in South Africa in 1996, eventually becoming their national Health Management Information System (HMIS) in 1999. DHIS—which later evolved into DHIS2—was designed from its initial conception to facilitate local data use.

### 2004: DHIS2 development begins

DHIS was designed as an offline system running on local databases. This resulted in challenges aggregating and sharing data and scaling up implementations over time. As a result, in 2004, development of the web-based version 2 of DHIS (DHIS2) began at the University of Oslo. As a web-based platform, DHIS2 offered significant increases in accessibility by allowing users to enter and access their data from anywhere with internet connectivity.

### 2006: DHIS2 launch

The first web-based DHIS2 implementation launched in 2006 in Kerala, India.

### 2010: DHIS2 implemented in Africa

2010 saw the first implementation of DHIS2 in Kenya. This was quickly followed by Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda. DHIS2 usage has continued to expand throughout Africa, supported by a network of local DHIS2 experts, who have helped build national and regional capacity for DHIS2 use and configuration. These efforts have made the region a center for local innovation with DHIS2.

### 2011: DHIS2 Academy launch

In 2011 the DHIS2 Academy launched. UiO, in collaboration with HISP groups, runs academies every year on a selection of key topics, including both in-person and online courses. The Academy program contributes to developing and sharing best practices in presenting various DHIS2 concepts, and courses are continually modified to meet the global community's needs.

### 2012: Joint international support for DHIS2

In 2012, the international development organizations the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund, and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) began a joint donor effort to fund DHIS2 to strengthen its use in countries. This support was instrumental in scaling up the deployment of DHIS2 across Africa and Asia.

### 2014: DHIS2 Ebola response

2014 saw DHIS2 used in Liberia for the Ebola response. The initial individual-level data models deployed there have since been expanded upon in the Tracker application, and are used for global case-based surveillance.

### 2015: DATIM launch

In 2015, DATIM, a PEPFAR-specific version of DHIS2, was launched. DATIM is now used by PEPFAR in more than 50 countries. DATIM continues to be one of the largest examples of a world-wide data warehouse within DHIS2; sharing standards and collating subnational data routinely across a large and varied geography.

### 2017: UiO becomes WHO Collaborating Centre

In 2017, UiO became an official World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Innovation and Implementation Research for health information systems strengthening. This collaboration led to the DHIS2 metadata concept, an innovative method of sharing best practice configuration and functionality.

### 2018: Community of Practice launch

In 2018, the DHIS2 Community of Practice launched, providing an online discussion forum that replaced the earlier DHIS2 technical support mailing list, making it easier for DHIS2 practitioners to connect and share best practices and get support from around the globe.

### 2019: DHIS2 for education

In 2019, DHIS2 was piloted as an Education Management Information System in the Gambia and Uganda. This configuration applies DHIS2's built-in analytics tools and flexible data structure to the field of education and school management, while also facilitating data triangulation between health and education sectors which can be useful in planning childhood vaccination campaigns, for example).

### 2020: COVID-19 response

In 2020, COVID-19 metadata packages for DHIS2 were launched. This allowed countries to rapidly implement case-based surveillance, contact tracing and ports of entry programs to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The global DHIS2 response to COVID-19 also featured many examples of local innovation (configurations and apps designed by the HISP network and Ministries of Health) that were shared with the global community, including real time data entry at border crossings, and paperless lab testing and reporting processes.

### 2021: COVID-19 vaccine delivery

In 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued, the HISP network developed and deployed additional metadata packages and tools to support the global effort to manage COVID-19 vaccine delivery.

### Now: Continuing evolution

DHIS2's features and capabilities are being expanded upon today, incorporating the latest web technologies to improve DHIS2's performance and increase its functionality. At the same time, governments, NGOs and other organizations continue to deploy DHIS2 to address new challenges and in new domains.

### DHIS2 around the world

Since DHIS launched in the nineties, DHIS2 has been implemented in over 70 countries around the world, and additional countries are deploying DHIS2 every year. The interactive map below shows you where and when DHIS2 was implemented.

Click on the items in the sidebar on the left to see the geographical scope of different DHIS2 implementations, including as a Health Management Information System (HMIS), for [<u>COVID-19 Surveillance</u>](https://www.dhis2.org/covid-surveillance) and [<u>COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery</u>](https://www.dhis2.org/covid-vaccine-delivery), for collecting individual-level data with [<u>Tracker</u>](https://dhis2.org/tracker-in-action/), for mobile data entry with the [<u>DHIS2 Android App</u>](https://dhis2.org/android-in-action/), for standardized [<u>WHO digital data packages</u>](https://dhis2.org/who/), and as an [<u>Education Management Information System</u>](https://dhis2.org/education/) (EMIS).
