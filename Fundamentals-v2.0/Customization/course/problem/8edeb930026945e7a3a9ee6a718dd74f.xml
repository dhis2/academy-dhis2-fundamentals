        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>DHIS2 Customization Practice database is split up in two different views: the learner view and the administrator view. You as a learner will only have access to the example metadata and any additional items that you create. Course administrators, on the other hand, will be able to access everything in the system including the various metadata that learners create in case they need support or have questions about exercises and assignments. None of the learners will be able see or access each otherÂ´s metadata.</p>
