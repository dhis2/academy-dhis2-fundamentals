<h3>Organisation units in the DHIS2 training databases</h3>
<p>When you register as a new user in the <strong>DHIS2 Customization Lab and DHIS2 Customization Practice systems</strong>, an organisation unit is automatically created for you called "Trainingland - your email." Only you and the course administrators can interact with this organisation unit.</p>

<p>When you create additional organisation units as part of your own activities, they will be under the umbrella of this root level unit.</p>
<p>This means that every user in the <strong>DHIS2 Customization Lab and DHIS2 Customization Practice systems</strong> has their own separate organisation unit hierarchy assigned to them in the system.</p>

<p><strong>NB: This does not apply to the Indicators Practice and Indicators Lab systems</strong></p>
