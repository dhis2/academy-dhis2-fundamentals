<h3>Creating data sets: Configuring the options</h3>
<p>In this video, you will learn how to create a data set in DHIS2, using the RMNCAH data set as an example. The video is divided into two parts. The first part walks you through the steps of creating a data set with a default data entry form. This process includes creating a data set in the Maintenance application, and correctly assigning data elements and organisation units. In the second part of the video, you will learn how to change the default form and into a section form by adding sections and ordering the data elements within each section.</p>
