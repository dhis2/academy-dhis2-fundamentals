<h3>Malaria program</h3>
<p>Malaria is an <strong>acute febrile illness</strong> caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Despite considerable efforts, <strong>malaria is still one of the most devastating infectious diseases</strong> in the tropics. In Africa, malaria continues to pose a huge public health challenge. In 2019, the World Health Organization estimated 229 million cases and 409,000 deaths due to malaria with over <strong>90% of the deaths occurring in Africa</strong>.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be using a small subset of a data set from a malaria burden reduction program. In burden reduction settings, malaria data collection is focused on aggregate numbers related to disease surveillance and treatment administered.</p>

<h3>How will you be working with the malaria use case in this course?</h3>
<p>You will be working with this data set in your <strong>pre-lab exercises</strong> and <strong>graded labs</strong>. Let’s have a look at the data collection form and give some further explanation to some of the elements that might be unfamiliar with if you don’t have a background in public health.</p>

<p>This data set contains <strong>three sections</strong>:</p>
<h4>1. Treatment</h4>

<p>Contains <strong>3 data elements</strong> related to the treatment of malaria. Some of the data elements contain specific terminology:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ACT</strong> = artemisinin-based combination therapy. ACT is recommended for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria. Fast acting artemisinin-based compounds are combined with a drug from a different class</li>
<li><strong>P. Falciparum</strong> = There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species–Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax–pose the greatest threat</li>
<li><strong>Primaquine</strong> = Primaquine is a prescription medicine used to prevent relapse of malaria (P. vivax malaria)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->


<h4>2. Cases</h4>


<p>Contains <strong>2 data elements</strong> related to malaria cases in patients who seek treatment from a facility:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Suspected malaria cases</strong></em> = Illness suspected by a health worker to be due to malaria, generally on the basis of the presence of fever with or without other symptoms</li>
<li><em><strong>Confirmed malaria cases</strong></em> = Total number of confirmed cases reported as malaria, confirmed with either microscopy or Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->


<h4>3. Laboratory</h4>

<p>Contains <strong>2 data elements</strong> related to malaria laboratory test result:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Malaria cases tested with microscopy</strong></em> = Suspected cases tested with malaria microscopy</li>
<li><em><strong>Malaria cases tested positive with microscopy</strong></em> = Cases confirmed as positive with microscopy</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Cases</em> and <em>Laboratory</em> sections, you can see the following disaggregations:</p>

<h4>4. Age disaggregation</h4>


<p><em>Cases</em> section is disaggregated into three different age groups: 0-4 years, 5-14 years, and 15+ years.</p>


<h4>5. Age &amp; Sex disaggregation</h4>


<p><em>Laboratory</em> section is disaggregated both by sex and by age so each value entered falls into one of six different fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>0-4 years, Male</li>
<li>0-4 years, Female</li>
<li>5-14 years, Male</li>
<li>5-14 years, Female</li>
<li>15+ years, Male</li>
<li>15+ years, Female</li>
</ul>
