<h3>Ungraded and graded activities</h3>
<p>In this course you will find several opportunities to check your understanding using ungraded activities and assess your progress through graded ones.</p>

<h3>What type of ungraded activities will you find in this course?</h3>
<p>There are <strong>three</strong> types of ungraded activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge Check Questions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>After each video you will find a variety of <strong>ungraded</strong> multiple choice, true or false and drag and drop questions. Once you submit each question, you will be able to read the explanation in case you need to refresh the concepts learned.</li>
<li>The purpose of knowledge check questions is to help you check your understanding and reinforce the key concepts covered in the videos. You will have unlimited attempts to respond correctly to each question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Activities</strong>
<ul>
<li>In most of the videos, you will see demonstrations of tasks performed in DHIS2. For you to have the chance to try those tasks, we have created activities as step-by-step guides to show you how to perform the same tasks in our training database. You can also go beyond our instructions and explore the database. This will be your playground to interact with DHIS2. Note that specific instructions on how to access the training databases will be provided before starting each activity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pre-Lab</strong> <strong>Exercises</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assignments in which you will reflect on what type of customization you will perform in DHIS2 and how to design those configurations before interacting with the platform. Pre-Lab exercises are needed to successfully complete the graded labs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>What type of graded activities will you find in the course?</h3>
<p>There are <strong>two</strong> types of graded activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module Quizzes</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>4 - 5 Multiple choice and true or false questions</strong> you will find at the end of each module. Questions focus on key concepts you need to learn to complete the course successfully. You will have 1 or 3 attempts to submit each question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Module Labs</strong>
<ul>
<li>You will be asked to show your practical skills by interacting with a DHIS2 database specifically created for this course to test your knowledge on customization. You will find a lab at the end of Modules 2 - 6. Labs should be completed in sequence. This means before starting Module 3’s Lab, you first need to successfully complete Module 2’s Lab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You will find specific instructions before starting any graded and ungraded activity.</p>
