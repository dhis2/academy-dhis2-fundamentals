<h3>Data sets: Design stage</h3>
<p>Before you start creating data sets in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. For the <strong>design or conceptual stage of creating data sets</strong>, there are several things you need to think about.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you need to decide which type of data set is the most suitable for your purpose. If your data set is based on a paper collection form, you usually start with a review of the form to decide which data set type to use. You also need to determine how often the data are collected (period) and where the data are collected (organisation units).</p>
<p>In the following series of videos, you will see how we create the RMNCAH data set. This means we will not cover the design phase in the videos, only the interaction with the Maintenance app. However, as in the previous modules, you will have the chance to reflect on the design of your DHIS2 instance before completing the graded lab (at the end of the module) by performing a pre-lab exercise on the malaria use case.</p>
