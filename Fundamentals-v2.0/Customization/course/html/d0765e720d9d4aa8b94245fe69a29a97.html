<h3>Discussion forum</h3>
<p>As we are reaching the end of the module, let's take some time to reflect on what you've learned and share your experience with DHIS2.</p>
<p>To do it, if you have already joined the course discussion forum, please click on the following link to join this specific discussion topic:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a target="_blank" href="https://community.dhis2.org/t/module-1-what-can-be-customized-in-dhis2/48377"><button class="button"><span class="button__text">What Can be Customized in DHIS2?</span></button></a></p>

<p>In this module you learned about the various ways DHIS2 can be adapted to be used across various domains and programs.</p>
<p>For the first module discussion, <strong>tell us if you are currently involved or going to be involved in a project that uses DHIS2</strong>? What is the purpose of the project and do you think DHIS2 will help you to achieve it? What are the DHIS2 tools that you will use and what aspects of the system have to be configured? Are there any challenges?</p>
<p>Please feel free to share your experience, read your peers’ responses and reflect on what you have learned so far in the course.</p>
<p>Even though this is an optional activity, we strongly recommend you take some time to think about your new knowledge, read what other course participants think, and make connections with your own prior experience and current learning needs. This will help you reinforce what you have learned and prepare for the next module.</p>
