<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Before you start creating your metadata in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. This is the <strong>design or conceptual stage of configuration</strong>. The purpose of this, and all the pre-lab exercises you will find along the course, is to focus on this design stage before completing the graded labs. This way you will be practicing the same configuration process you would do in a real DHIS2 customization context.</p>

<h3>Overview of the exercise</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will <strong>review the types of data disaggregation</strong> applied throughout the Malaria form and <strong>convert them to the DHIS2 category model</strong>.</p>
<p>This exercise has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designing the category model for the malaria age disaggregation</li>
<li>Designing the category model for the malaria age and sex disaggregation</li>
</ol>
