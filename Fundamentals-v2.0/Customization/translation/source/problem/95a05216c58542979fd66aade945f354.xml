        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>The aggregation type defines how the data for a data element is aggregated in analytics, meaning in the pivot table, charts and maps. If you set the aggregation type to "Sum" for a data element, the data values will be summed and presented as an aggregated value of all organisation units selected. For example, if a district level organisation unit is selected, you would get the summed value for all facility level organisation units in that district.
