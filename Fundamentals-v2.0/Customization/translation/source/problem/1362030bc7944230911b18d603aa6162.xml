        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>While it is possible to do most of the simple metadata configuration via the user interface, there are some drawbacks to doing this at a large scale with adding hundreds of metadata items. At this scale, you would rather set up the metadata via mass import functionality rather than adding them individually. </p>
