<h3>Lab overview</h3>
<p>In this graded activity, you will apply the knowledge and skills that you gained throughout Module 3. You will create a complete category model based on the Malaria data set.</p>
<p>In this graded lab, you will work with metadata that you created in labs of previous modules. If you didn't complete the previous labs, you won't be able to pass this one. Remember that the passing grade for labs is 100%. You can check your score and overall progress on the “Progress page”.</p>
<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>
<p>This is a graded lab that counts for <strong>16%</strong> of your final grade. You have unlimited attempts to successfully complete this assignment. To get a passing grade, you need to complete all steps correctly.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Review the design work you created in the previous exercise and create the complete category model in DHIS2 using the Malaria data set.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1626b1QUi5IkXxx44aJnwWV2eL3bTA6FVr4JVwuXWyqY/edit#gid=1271273578" target="_blank"><u>configuration spreadsheet</u></a>, <strong>create all the required category options, categories  and category combination(s)</strong> from the Malaria data set.</p>
<p>Note: When you create categories and category options remember to use your <em><strong>initials_category option name</strong></em> in order to give your metadata a unique name in the system. For example, if you want to create a category option <strong>“Male”</strong> and your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’ and last name with ‘D’ it will be called <em><strong>SND_Male</strong>.</em> If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead as we recommend using a three letter prefix convention. This also applies to <strong>short name</strong> and <strong>code</strong>, if used.</p>
<p>Tip: When creating categories, remember to follow the <strong>order: category options → categories → category combination(s)</strong></p>

<h3>Submit your work</h3>
<p>Once you complete all the tasks in this exercise, you can submit your work by clicking the "Submit" button just one time and wait up to one minute while your work is evaluated. During this process, you will see "Loading" on the button.</p>

<h3>View your grade</h3>
<p>The system will evaluate your work automatically. You will get a pass/fail grade for each part of the exercise. If you made a mistake in this exercise, you will get specific feedback that will help you understand how you can fix your mistake and try again. Remember you have unlimited attempts to complete this lab.</p>
