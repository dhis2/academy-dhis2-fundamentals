<h3>Creating indicators: ANC dropout rate</h3>
<p>In the previous video, you learned how to create an indicator where the numerator and denominator both contain one data element. In this video, you will learn to create a slightly more complex indicator where the numerator contains two data elements. As you already know, you can add more than one data element in the indicatorâ€™s numerator or the denominator using a mathematical operator to form an expression, such as adding them together or subtracting them from one another. Continuing with our RMNCAH data set, we will now create the ANC1-8 dropout rate indicator.</p>
