<p>Note: When creating the hierarchy, use <em><strong>Your initials_Name</strong></em> in order to identify which organisation units you have created. For example, if you want to create <strong>Animal Region</strong> and your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’, and last name with ‘D’ it will be called <strong><em>SND_Animal Region.</em></strong> If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead. This also applies to <strong>short name</strong> and <strong>code</strong>, if used.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Create the organisation unit groups and group sets</h3>
<p>For the organisation unit group set of ownership type, you need to create the following two groups: private and public. Using the template below, create the two groups and the group set.</p>
