<h3>Data element disaggregations: Design stage</h3>
<p>Before you start creating your metadata in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. This is the <strong>design</strong> or <strong>conceptual stage of configuration,</strong> which is usually done outside of DHIS2 and before interacting with the database.</p>
<p>You already learned that data element disaggregations, such as sex and age, are created separately from data elements. In the design stage of creating these disaggregations, you need to <strong>identify the types of data disaggregations</strong> applied throughout the data collection form and <strong>convert them to the DHIS2 category model</strong>. In practice, this means listing all the <strong>category options</strong>, grouping them into <strong>categories</strong>, and then combining categories to create the correct <strong>category combination</strong>.</p>
<p>In the following videos, you will see how we create the disaggregations for the RMNCAH use case. This means we will not cover the design phase in the videos, only the interaction with the Maintenance app. However, as in the previous module, you will have the chance to reflect on the design of your DHIS2 instance before completing the graded lab (at the end of the module) by performing a pre-lab exercise on the malaria use case.</p>
<p>For the designing or conceptual stage, it is best practice to use a document such as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1626b1QUi5IkXxx44aJnwWV2eL3bTA6FVr4JVwuXWyqY/edit?usp=sharing" target=none><u>configuration spreadsheet</u></a> where this information is stored externally to DHIS2. When creating these metadata, you can copy and paste the data from the spreadsheet to the different fields of the Maintenance app.</p>
