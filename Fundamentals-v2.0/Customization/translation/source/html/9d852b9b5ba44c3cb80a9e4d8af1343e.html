<h3>Pre-lab exercise: Designing data elements</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Before you start creating your metadata in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. This is the <strong>design or conceptual stage of configuration</strong> which is usually done outside of DHIS2 and prior to interacting with the database. The purpose of the pre-lab exercises throughout the course is to focus on this design stage before completing the graded labs. This way you will be practicing the same configuration process you would complete in a real DHIS2 customization context.</p>

<h3>Overview of the exercise</h3>

<p>In this pre-lab exercise, you need to design the data elements in the malaria use case. You will reflect on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data element parameters</li>
<li>Assigning the correct category combinations to the data elements</li>
<li>Grouping data elements into groups and group sets</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>After completing each part, you can download the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1626b1QUi5IkXxx44aJnwWV2eL3bTA6FVr4JVwuXWyqY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">configuration spreadsheet</a></strong> and you are ready to continue with the lab graded assignment.</p>
