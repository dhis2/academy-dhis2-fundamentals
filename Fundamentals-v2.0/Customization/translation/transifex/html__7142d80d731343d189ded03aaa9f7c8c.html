<h3>Verifying indicators in the Data Visualizer app</h3>
<p>Now that we have created the indicators in DHIS2 for our RMNCAH (provided that our DHIS2 system has data for the data elements that make up these indicators), it is best practice to confirm the calculation using a data visualization. In this video, you will learn how to perform this confirmation using the Data Visualizer app. This video will only provide a brief overview of how the Data Visualizer app works so that you can use it for this specific activity. You can learn more about this app and other data analysis tools in DHIS2 by taking the DHIS2 Data Analysis course.</p>
