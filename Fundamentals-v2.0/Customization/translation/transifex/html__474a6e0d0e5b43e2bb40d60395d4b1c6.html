<h3><strong>Creating indicators: ANC coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you reviewed some of the concepts related to indicators and their use, let's use that knowledge to create indicators in DHIS2. In this series of videos, you will learn how to create two indicators using the data elements from the RMNCAH data set. This process includes defining the indicator type (or the factor), and editing the numerator and denominator. This video is divided into two parts. In Part 1, we will create the ANC 4 Coverage (%) indicator. In Part 2, we will create the ANC1-8 dropout rate indicator.</p>
<p>To review the specific details of these indicators, refer to the explanation in the previous lesson <strong>indicator concepts and examples</strong>.</p>
