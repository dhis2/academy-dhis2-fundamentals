        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>It is best practice that an organisation unit be a member of only one of the groups in a group set if that group set is used in analytics. A violation of this rule would lead to duplication of data when aggregating health facility data by the different groups, as a facility assigned to two groups in the same group set would be counted twice.</p>
