<p>In this module, you learned how to create an organisation unit hierarchy and group your organisation units unto groups and group sets.</p>
<p>For this discussion, <strong>we encourage you to tell us about your experience creating and working with disaggregations. Were you able to assign the category options to categories in the correct order? Were you able to assign the categories to the category combination in the correct order?</strong> Let us know if there were concepts that you found a little more difficult to understand or if you have any questions related to the material.</p>
<p>We invite you to share your experience, read your peers’ responses and reflect on what you have learned so far in the course.</p>
<p>Even though this is an <strong>optional activity</strong>, we strongly recommend you take some time to think about your new knowledge, read what other course participants think, and make connections with your own prior experience and current learning needs. This will help you reinforce what you have learned and prepare for the next module.</p>
