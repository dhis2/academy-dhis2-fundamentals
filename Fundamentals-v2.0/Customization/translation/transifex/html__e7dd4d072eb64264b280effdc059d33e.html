<h3>Orientation to organisation units</h3>
<p>In the Introduction to DHIS2 course, you learned about the <strong>Where</strong> dimension of DHIS2: organisation units. Organisation units represent the geographical dimension of the data. They define where data are <strong>captured</strong> and how they can be <strong>aggregated</strong> from a geographical/organizational perspective, such as aggregation from facility data to regional data, and from regional to national levels. You also learned about alternative ways of grouping facilities using <strong>organisation unit groups</strong> and <strong>organisation unit group sets</strong>, which are useful in data analysis.</p>

<h3>Key concepts:</h3>

<li>Organisation unit hierarchy</li>
<li>Organisation unit groups</li>
<li>Organisation unit group sets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Organisation unit hierarchy</h3>

<p>In DHIS2, organisation units form a <strong>hierarchical tree</strong> that has several levels. Generally, the lowest level is comprised of locations where data collection occurs. Most often these are facilities, schools or villages. The higher level represents various larger geographical and administrative areas.</p>
<p>During the aggregation process, data are added up from the lower organisation unit levels to the higher ones. DHIS2 performs these calculations automatically. The number of levels in a hierarchy and the level names depend on each implementation’s context.</p>

<h3>Organisation unit groups and group sets</h3>

<p>In this example above, health facilities are classified and clustered by the range of services they provide, into various <strong>organisation unit groups</strong>, such as Dispensary, Health Center, Specialist Hospital, and Referral Hospital.</p>
<p>The <strong>organisation unit group set</strong> is the name for the umbrella classification that these individual groups fall under. In this example, the group set is <strong>Facility Type</strong>, a category that contains the organisation unit groups, which in turn each contain specific facilities.</p>
<p>To refresh your knowledge of concepts related to organisation units we suggest you refer back to the organisation unit video from the Introduction to DHIS2 course:</p>
