<h3>Practice databases</h3>
<p>The DHIS2 Customization Practice and Indicator databases are essentially DHIS2 systems that have been preconfigured to create an optimal environment for your practice and exploration in this course. DHIS2 Customization Practice already has some existing data elements that belong to the RMNCAH program and are used as references in demonstrations and activities.</p>
<p>One of the basic features of those databases is that the system is split up into two different views: the <strong>learner</strong> view and the <strong>administrator</strong> view. You, as a learner, will only have access to the metadata used in the examples and any additional items that you create, but you will not see any metadata created by other course participants. However, course administrators will have access to metadata created by all course participants. If you need support or have questions about exercises and assignments, the course administrators can view your work and help you.</p>

<p>You will see that in both databases there are already some preexisting metadata that you can use for your reference; you can view their names and properties.</p>

<h3><strong>Lab databases</strong></h3>
<p>Lab databases are very similar in function to the practice databases except they are used for graded labs. We ask you to only use them to create the metadata per instructions since <strong>there is an automatic script that will check your progress and give you a grade at the end of the lab</strong>. If you create more or different metadata than you were asked to do, it might result in you not getting a passing result.</p>

<h3>Metadata naming conventions (Practice and Lab databases)</h3>
<p>You and all of the course participants will be creating your metadata in the same practice database, performing the same activities, and creating the same metadata, even if you won't be able to see or access the metadata that other students have created. In DHIS2, <strong>metadata must have a unique name</strong>. Since all learners will be creating the same metadata and following the same naming conventions, we ask you to <strong>add your initials as a prefix to any metadata you create</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to recreate the data element <em>ANC 1st visit</em>, the system would give me the error, “This field requires a unique value”. This means that another user has already created a data element with the same name.</p>
<p>That is why we ask you to <strong>use your initials</strong> <strong>when creating any metadata items</strong> to make the name unique in the system. In this example, if your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’, and last name with ‘D’ it will be called <strong>“<em>SND_RMNCAH - ANC 1st visit”</em>.</strong> If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead as we recommend using a three letter prefix convention.</p>

<h3>To recap</h3>
<p>The DHIS2 Customization Practice database provides you with a dedicated space to create and modify metadata. You will only see the items you have created yourself or those that the course administrators have shared with you, and will not interact with items other participants have made.</p>
<p>Because there will be many other learners creating metadata in the same system, it's important to consider the naming of your items. You must add your initials or another unique identifier as a prefix to all metadata items you create.</p>
