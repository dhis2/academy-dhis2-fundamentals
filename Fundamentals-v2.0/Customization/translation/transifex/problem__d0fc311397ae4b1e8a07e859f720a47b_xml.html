        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>All answers are correct. Firstly, using the category model allows for more flexibility in displaying the data. For example, if a data element has both sex and age disaggregation, in visualizations, you don't have to be limited by that. You can display the data solely by sex or by age. </p>
        <p>Secondly, without the category model, you would have to create a separate data element for each disaggregation, but using categories, you only have to create one data element and then assign the correct category combination to it. DHIS2 will generate all these specific combinations automatically and create all the fields in the data entry form. This also saves time when the data element has many disaggregations. </p>
