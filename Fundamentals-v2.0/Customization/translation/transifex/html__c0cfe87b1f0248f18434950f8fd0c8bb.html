<h3>Orientation to the Training databases</h3>

<h3></h3>
<p>At the DHIS2 Academy we believe in learning by doing. To master new DHIS2 skills, it is important that you put into practice what you learn. You can engage with the system and try out what you have learned in a DHIS2 training environment that we have set up for you.</p>
<p>In this course, you will be using <strong>4 different training databases</strong> depending on which module you are in and whether it is:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>A sandbox database</b> for your ungraded activities and exploration
<ol>
<li>Customization Practice</li>
<li>Indicators Practice</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>An assessment database</strong> used for graded labs
<ol>
<li>Customization Lab</li>
<li>Indicators Lab</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>As you saw in Module 0, we will be using two use cases along the course: RMNCAH and malaria. Practice databases use RMNCAH as an example, while graded labs use malaria for the exercises.</p>
<p>Look at the table below for an overview of the databases, use cases and modules:</p>

<h3>How can I make sure which database to use when?</h3>
<p>For each activity or graded lab, <strong>you will find a link to the correct database</strong>.</p>
<img src="/static/ActivityDatabaseIndication.png"/>

<p>When you click on the link, it will open the sign in page in a new window in your browser. <strong>The name of the database you are currently in will be indicated in the upper left corner and under the DHIS2 Academy logo.</strong> To log in, you will need to create an account and use your sign in details. You will create the accounts for the training databases in the next section.</p>

<h3>To wrap-up</h3>
<p>In Modules 2-5, you will be using Customization Practice and Customization Lab databases. The difference is that your <strong>practice database</strong> is your playground where <strong>you can perform ungraded activities</strong> or you can engage in your own exploration. If you want an overview of what a complete data set looks like in DHIS2, you can use the credentials provided on the login page to access the complete RMNCAH database. Please note that you will only be able to view these data, not interact with the platform. To create metadata and complete the ungraded activities, you must log in with your own credentials.</p>
<p>The <strong>lab database</strong> <strong>is strictly for the graded labs</strong>. Unlike in the practice database, when interacting with the lab database, <strong>you need to adhere to the instructions exactly</strong>, and only create the metadata we ask you to create for the grading scripts to work well.</p>
<p>In Module 6 there is a separate database for practice and labs since you will create indicators and access analytic applications.</p>
