<h3>Discussion forum</h3>

<p>As we are reaching the end of the module, let's take some time to reflect on what you've learned and discuss the key concepts covered so far.
To do it, if you have already joined the course discussion forum, please click on the following link to join this specific discussion topic:</p>

<p>In this module, you learned how to create data elements and classify them into groups and group sets.</p>
<p>For this discussion, <strong>we encourage you to tell us about your experience creating and working with data elements.</strong> Can you think of any data elements that contain other than numerical values? If you already have experience working with DHIS2, what is your take on using naming conventions, do you currently use them? Do you think they are useful and why? Let us know if there were concepts that you found a little more difficult to understand or if you have any questions related to the material.</p>
<p>We invite you to share your experience, read your peers’ responses and reflect on what you have learned so far in the course.</p>
<p>Even though this is an <strong>optional activity</strong>, we strongly recommend you take some time to think about your new knowledge, read what other course participants think, and make connections with your own prior experience and current learning needs. This will help you reinforce what you have learned and prepare for the next module.</p>
