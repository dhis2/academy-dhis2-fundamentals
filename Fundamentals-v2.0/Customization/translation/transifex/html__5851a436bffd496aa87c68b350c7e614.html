<h3>Lab overview</h3>
<p>In this graded lab, you will apply the knowledge and skills that you gained throughout Module 6. In the first part, you will be asked to create two indicators based on the Malaria data set that you have designed in the pre-lab exercise of this module. In the second part, you will group your indicators into a group and add the group to a group set.</p>


<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>This is a graded lab and counts for <strong>16%</strong> of your final grade. To successfully complete this lab you need to <strong>complete all the steps correctly</strong> and you will have <strong>unlimited attempts</strong> to submit your results.</p>
<p>Remember that the passing grade for labs is 100%. You can check your score and overall progress on the “Progress" page.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Create the indicators</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Create two indicators:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAL - Malaria cases total</li>
<li>MAL - Malaria cases treated with any antimalarial medicine (%)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any doubt about how to construct these two indicators and which data elements you need to use, refer back to the <a href="https://academy.dhis2.org/courses/course-v1:hisp+GEN-D004-en+2022_Q2/courseware/b2994e641ac2453cb091e207460db5a7/cbe78d5d8cb1441cbffed668ea7c5e49/?child=last" target = none> pre-lab exercise of this module.</a></p>
<p>You can also refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1626b1QUi5IkXxx44aJnwWV2eL3bTA6FVr4JVwuXWyqY/edit?usp=sharing" target = none>Malaria configuration spreadsheet</a> for details on these Indicators. 
<p>Note: As with other types of metadata, when creating indicators, use your <em><strong>initials_Indicator</strong></em> <em><strong>Name</strong></em> in order to identify which indicator you have created. All metadata in the system require unique names and since there are other users creating the same indicators, adding initials will ensure that you will be able to save your indicator. For example, if you want to create an indicator <strong>“Malaria cases total”</strong> and your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’, and last name with ‘D’ it will be called “<strong>SND_MAL - Malaria cases total”</strong>. If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead. This also applies to <strong>short name</strong> and <strong>code</strong>, if used.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Add indicators into a group</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>As a second part of this lab, you will need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an indicator group “Malaria program” and add the two indicators you created in part 1 of the lab</li>
<li>Create an indicator group set “Health programs” and the add the “Malaria program” indicator group to it</li>
</ol>

<h3>Submit your work</h3>
<p>Once you complete all the tasks in this exercise, submit your work by clicking the "Submit" button just one time and wait up to one minute while your work is evaluated. During this process, you will see "Loading" on the button.</p>

<h3>View your grade</h3>
<p>The system will evaluate your work automatically. You will get a pass/fail grade for each part of the exercise. If you made a mistake in this exercise, you will get specific feedback to help you understand how you can fix your mistake and try again. Remember you have unlimited attempts to complete this lab.</p>
