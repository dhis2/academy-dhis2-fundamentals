<h3>What is in this module?</h3>
<p>In the previous module, you learned about all the pieces you need to customize to set up a new DHIS2 system. One of those important pieces are <strong>organisation units</strong>. Organisation units <strong>determine the geographical context for the data</strong>. They can be at the level of facilities (where the data values are collected) or larger boundaries such as districts and regions. As you know, the various levels determine where data are captured and how they can be aggregated, for example, from facility data to district data and above.</p>

<h3>Learning objectives:</h3>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a three-level organisation unit hierarchy with facilities, districts and regions.</li>
<li>Group facilities into organisation unit groups and group sets based on criteria such as type of facility and ownership status</li>
</ul>

<h3>How will you be evaluated?</h3>
<p>At the end of the module, you will find 2 graded activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quiz:</strong> 4 multiple choice, or true or false questions. You will have between 1 and 3 attempts to answer each question correctly. You will find the number of attempts permitted by question next to the submit button. This contributes to <strong>3%</strong> of your final grade</li>
<li><strong>Lab:</strong> You will be asked to perform specific tasks in our DHIS2 training instance. To pass the lab, you will need to correctly perform all the steps. This lab contributes to <strong>16%</strong> of your final grade</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long will this module take?</h3>
<p>This module should take about <strong>2 hours and 20 minutes</strong> to complete.</p>
