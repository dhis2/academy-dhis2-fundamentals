<p>Note: When creating the data set, use your <em><strong>initials_Name</strong></em> in order to identify which data set you have created. For example, if you want to create “<strong>Malaria Burden reduction”</strong> data set and your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’, and last name with ‘D’ it will be called <strong>“SND_MAL - Malaria Burden Reduction”</strong>. If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead. This also applies to <strong>short name</strong> and <strong>code</strong>, if used.</p>

<p>Tip: To pass this lab you need to configure all the fields correctly. You will need to correctly assign the <strong>period</strong>, <strong>organisation units</strong> and all the <strong>data elements</strong> that belong to the data set. Create a data set with sections, section headings and correctly order data elements within the sections.</p>
