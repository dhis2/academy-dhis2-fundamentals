<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of the pre-lab exercises throughout the course is to focus on this design stage before completing the graded labs. This way, you will be practicing the same configuration process you would complete in a real DHIS2 customization context.</p>

<h3>Designing data sets</h3>
<p>In this exercise, we will start by reviewing the malaria burden reduction data collection form and thinking about how that might translate into a DHIS2 data set. In the second part of the exercise, we will reflect on the sharing settings so that designated users or user groups can enter data in the data entry form in DHIS2.</p>
