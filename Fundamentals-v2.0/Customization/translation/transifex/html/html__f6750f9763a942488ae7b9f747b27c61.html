<h3>Orientation to example data: RMNCAH and malaria health programs</h3>
<p>Throughout this course we will be using two common examples of data collected in DHIS2 belonging to two health programs. The first one is a <strong>R</strong>eproductive, <strong>M</strong>aternal, <strong>N</strong>ewborn, <strong>C</strong>hild and <strong>A</strong>dolescent <strong>H</strong>ealth <strong>(RMNCAH) program</strong> and the second one is a <strong>malaria program.</strong></p>
<p>These data sets are based on real use cases, but with a reduced scope that allows us to focus on learning how to customize them in DHIS2 at a basic level. Letâ€™s introduce the two examples and look at how you will be working with them in this course.</p>
