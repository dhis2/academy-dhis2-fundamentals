<h3>Welcome to DHIS2 Aggregate Customization</h3>
<p>Welcome to the DHIS2 Aggregate Customization course, part of the DHIS2 Fundamentals courses program. In the Introduction to DHIS2 course, you gained an overview of DHIS2 and how it can be used to handle large amounts of data from various sources and formats, generate visualizations, and make informed decisions. In this course, we will explain how to customize your own DHIS2 instance to build your organisation’s unit hierarchy, create data sets that enable data collection, and configure disaggregations and indicators to facilitate data analysis, among other features.</p>
<p>This is the fourth course in the DHIS2 Fundamentals course program, which also contains the <strong>Introduction to DHIS2, Aggregate Data Capture and Validation</strong>, <strong>Aggregate Data Analysis,</strong> and <strong>DHIS2 Events Fundamentals</strong> courses. If you are interested in getting a higher level of training on DHIS2, you will find information about Level 1 Academies at the end of the course.</p>

<h3>What is this course about?</h3>
<p>You already know what DHIS2 can do. But, how can you adapt DHIS2 to meet your context needs? How can you transform paper forms into digital data sets to collect your data? What can you do to enhance data analysis through DHIS2 configuration? The DHIS2 Customization course addresses these questions as you learn to configure your DHIS2 instance using the Maintenance app.</p>

<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
<p>After completing this course, you’ll be able to customize a blank DHIS2 system using the <strong>DHIS2 Maintenance app</strong> to create and edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>An organisation unit hierarchy</li>
<li>Data elements</li>
<li>Data element disaggregations</li>
<li>Data sets</li>
<li>Indicators</li>
<li>User access and permissions settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the course prerequisites?</h3>
<p>You need to complete the <strong>Introduction to DHIS2</strong> course before starting this course.</p>

<h3>How is the course structured?</h3>
<p>Aggregate Customization Fundamentals has 6 modules of content, an introductory module and a closing and next steps section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 0: Start here (40 min)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 1: What can be customized in DHIS2 (1 h)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 2: Creating organisation units (2h 20 min) </strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 3: Creating categories (1 h 30 min) </strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 4: Creating data elements (1 h 15 min)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 5: Creating data sets and configuring sharing settings (2 h 45 min)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Module 6: Creating indicators (2 h 10 min)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Closing and next steps (10 min)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>How will I learn?</h3>
<p>In each module, you will find the content presented in text and videos of approximately 5-10 minutes in length, followed by <strong>ungraded knowledge check questions</strong> and <strong>step-by-step activities</strong> that will guide your practice within the DHIS2 training instance. At the end of each module you will find the <strong>graded activities</strong> in the form of <strong>quizzes</strong> and <strong>assessment labs</strong>. To get ready for the graded labs, you will find <strong>pre-lab exercises</strong> that will guide you on how to design your DHIS2 instance. You will find more about the types of graded and ungraded activities and the grading policy in the next section.</p>

<h3>How long will it take to complete the course?</h3>
<p>We estimate the course will take approximately <strong>12 hours</strong> to complete. This includes the review of all videos, and completing the ungraded and graded activities. As this is a self-paced course, this may vary slightly for each learner.</p>

<h3>How do I pass the course?</h3>
<p>The course consists of 2 types of graded activities that contribute to your final grade: <strong>quizzes</strong> and <strong>labs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quizzes</strong>: At the end of each module you will find a graded quiz that will assess your comprehension of the main concepts of DHIS2 Customization. The quizzes combined contribute to <strong>20% of your final grade</strong>. Each quiz consists of 4 or 5 questions and is worth 3 - 5% of your final grade. </li>
<li><strong>Labs</strong>: In the graded labs you will apply the knowledge gained in each module. Labs combined contribute to <strong>80% of your final grade</strong>. There are total of 5 assessment labs throughout the course and each one makes up 16% of your final grade:
<ul>
<li>Module 2: Creating organisation units (16%)</li>
<li>Module 3: Creating categories (16%)</li>
<li>Module 4: Creating data elements (16%)</li>
<li>Module 5: Creating data sets and configuring sharing settings (16%)</li>
<li>Module 6: Creating indicators (16%)</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>You will have unlimited attempts to successfully pass the Labs, but to pass you need to complete all the practical steps correctly, therefore a passing grade for each lab is 100%.</p>
<p>To pass the course, you need to reach the minimum of 85% from both types of graded activities combined.</p>
<p>You will find more details about the different types of learning activities in the section “<a href="https://academy.dhis2.org/courses/course-v1:hisp+GEN-D004-en+2022_Q2/courseware/aaa71f31d8da41668e310646a87aff39/ef13779aade7467c97d30af430437ea2/2?activate_block_id=block-v1%3Ahisp%2BGEN-D004-en%2B2022_Q2%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40b3ad20db7e5b446189270e137be018d6" target="_blank"><u>Ungraded and graded activities</u></a>”</p>
