<h3>RMNCAH program</h3>
<p>RMNCAH health services are related to <strong>reproductive</strong>, <strong>maternal</strong>, <strong>newborn</strong>, <strong>child</strong> and <strong>adolescent</strong> health. RMNCAH encompasses health services from pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and birth, to the immediate postnatal period for women and newborns through to childhood and adolescence. RMNCAH focuses on preventive, promotive and treatment interventions throughout the life course. Having good RMNCAH care is an effective way to reduce mortality and improve health outcomes for women, newborns, children and adolescents.</p>

<h3>How will you be working with the RMNCAH use case in this course?</h3>

<p>This data set contains three sections:</p>

<h4>1. Antenatal care</h4>

<p>The first section contains <strong>3</strong> <strong>data elements</strong> related to antenatal care, which is health care that pregnant women get from health professionals during pregnancy. These data elements represent the number of women that attended an antenatal visit at each stage:</p>

<li><em><strong>Antenatal care 4th visit</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Antenatal care 8th or more visit</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<p>Contains <strong>2 data elements</strong> related to the number of deliveries in the facility:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Delivery in facility</strong></em> = the total number of deliveries in the facility (including by caesarean section)</li>
<li><em><strong>Delivery in facility by caesarean section</strong></em> = the number of deliveries by caesarean section only</li>

<h4>5. Age &amp; Sex disaggregation</h4>
<p>Data in the <em>Family planning</em> section is disaggregated both by sex (male and female) and by age (using the same categories as above) so each value entered falls into one of six different fields:</p>

<li>15-19 years, Male</li>
