<h3>Course closing</h3>
<p>You have now finished the DHIS2 Aggregate Customization Fundamentals course. You should now have a good grasp of the fundamental concepts and applications for design and customization of aggregate data systems. You should now be able to use the DHIS2 Maintenance app to create and manage organisation units, data elements, data sets and indicators, as well as manage user access to those metadata. Remember, even though you have completed the course you are able to return to it to access this self-paced course again in the future, so if you need to revisit a concept or demonstration, just come back to the DHIS2 online academy and review the course.</p>
