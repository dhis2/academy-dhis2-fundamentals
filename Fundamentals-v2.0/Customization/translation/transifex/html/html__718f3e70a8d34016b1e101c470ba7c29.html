<h3>Data elements: Design stage</h3>
<p>Before you start creating data elements in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. For the <strong>design or conceptual stage</strong> of creating data elements, there are quite a few things that you need to think about.</p>
<p>The first step in this process would be to create a list of data elements that need to be configured. It is best practice to follow agreed upon standards for naming data elements so the system is easy to navigate.</p>
<p>The second step would be to fill in all their DHIS2-specific parameters. Data elements have a lot of compulsory configurable fields. Besides the familiar fields such as, name, short name, code and description, you have data element-specific fields, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain type</li>
<li>Value type</li>
<li>Aggregation type</li>
<li>Category combination</li>
</ul>
<p>Data elements can also be grouped into groups and group sets based on criteria, such as belonging to a specific program. In a typical workflow, once you gather all this information into your configurable spreadsheet, you are ready to start creating data elements in DHIS2. You can download your pre-filled configuration spreadsheet for the RMNCAH use case <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xQTsnnfi9S8UzUtCVq8MKAL6PQ88V15LBwoOrktKOg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p>In the following videos, you will see how we create the data elements for the RMNCAH use case. This means we will not cover the design phase in the videos, only the interaction with the Maintenance app. However, as in the previous modules, you will have the chance to reflect on the design of your DHIS2 instance before completing the graded lab (at the end of the module) by performing a pre-lab exercise on the malaria use case.</p>
