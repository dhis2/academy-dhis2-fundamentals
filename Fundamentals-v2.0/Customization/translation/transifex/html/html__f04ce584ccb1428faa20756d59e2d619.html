<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1626b1QUi5IkXxx44aJnwWV2eL3bTA6FVr4JVwuXWyqY/edit#gid=1271273578" target="_blank"><u>malaria configuration spreadsheet</u></a>, you will find all the information you need to create the <strong>data elements, data element groups, and group sets</strong> in the Customization Lab.</p>
<p>Note that you will need to use the Data Elements page of the spreadsheet to complete this lab.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the Data Elements page and create all the data elements you find there.</li>
<li>Once you are done creating the data elements, create the data element groups and group sets.</li>
</ol>
<p>When completing the lab, you should focus specifically on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assigning the correct value type and aggregation type</li>
<li>Assigning the correct category combination to your data elements based on the type of disaggregation they have (none, age only or combination of age &amp; sex)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: When you create data elements remember to use your <em><strong>initials_ DE name</strong></em> in order to give your metadata a unique name in the system. For example, if you want to create a data element <em><strong>“Malaria cases confirmed”</strong></em> and your name starts with ‘S’, your middle name with ‘N’ and last name with ‘D’ it will be called <strong>“<em>SND_Malaria cases confirmed”</em></strong>. If you don’t have a middle name, you can use the first two letters of your family name instead as we recommend using a three letter prefix convention. This also applies to <strong>short name</strong> and <strong>code</strong>, if used. </p>

<h3>Submit your work</h3>
<p>Once you complete all the tasks in this exercise, submit your work by clicking the "Submit" button just one time and wait up to one minute while your work is evaluated. During this process, you will see "Loading" on the button.</p>

<h3>View your grade</h3>
<p>The system will evaluate your work automatically. You will get a pass/fail grade for each part of the exercise. If you made a mistake in this exercise, you will get specific feedback to help you understand how you can fix your mistake and try again. Remember you have unlimited attempts to complete this lab.</p>
