<h3>Organisation units: Design stage</h3>
<p>Before you start creating your metadata in DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. This is the <strong>design or conceptual stage of configuration,</strong> which is usually done outside of DHIS2 and before interacting with the database.</p>
<p>This conceptual stage of creating organisation units includes <strong>designing the hierarchy</strong> so you have a good overview of the parent-child relationships between the organisation units you are creating. You also need to gather all identifiable information about each organisation unit in the system, such as names, codes and descriptions. Lastly, you need to decide on the criteria for how to best group your organisation units into groups and group sets, to suit your analytical needs.</p>
<p>In the following videos, you will see how we create metadata using the RMNCAH use case we explained in Module 0. This means we will not cover the design phase in the videos, only the interaction with the Maintenance app. However, you will have the chance to reflect on the design of your DHIS2 instance before completing the graded lab (at the end of the module) by performing a pre-lab exercise on the malaria use case.</p>
<p>For the design stage, it is best practice to use a document, such as a configuration spreadsheet, where this information is stored externally to DHIS2. When creating these metadata, you can copy and paste the data from the spreadsheet to the different fields of the Maintenance app.</p>
<p>To start familiarizing yourself with the spreadsheet, you can check the one we created for the demos that relate to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xQTsnnfi9S8UzUtCVq8MKAL6PQ88V15LBwoOrktKOg/edit?usp=sharing" target=none><u>RMNCAH use case</u></a>.</p>
