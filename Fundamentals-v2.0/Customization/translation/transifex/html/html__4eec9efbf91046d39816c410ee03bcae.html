<h3>Indicators: Design stage</h3>
<p>As with any other kind of metadata, before you go to DHIS2, it is important to know what metadata you will be creating and their parameters. For the <strong>design or conceptual stage of creating indicators</strong>, there are several things you need to think about.</p>
<p>Before creating indicators in DHIS2, you should be able to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I construct the formula to calculate this indicator?</li>
<li>What data element(s) go into the numerator?</li>
<li>What data element(s) go into the denominator?</li>
<li>Is annualization needed?</li>
<li>What is the factor (1, 100, 10,000)?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following series of videos, you will see how we create two indicators based on the RMNCAH data set. This means we will not cover the design phase in the videos, only the interaction with the Maintenance app. However, as in the previous modules you will have the chance to reflect on the design of your DHIS2 instance before completing the graded lab (at the end of the module) by performing a pre-lab exercise on the malaria use case.</p>
