<h3>Orientation to categories</h3>
<p>In DHIS2, data elements, such as "Malaria cases" or “ANC visits”, are often divided into disaggregations such as age or sex. This makes a detailed analysis feasible and improves decision-making. For example, using age disaggregations, we can determine the number of confirmed malaria cases within particular age groups. To create these disaggregations, DHIS2 uses a concept called <strong>Categories</strong>. This video will cover the conceptual design of the category model in DHIS2.</p>
