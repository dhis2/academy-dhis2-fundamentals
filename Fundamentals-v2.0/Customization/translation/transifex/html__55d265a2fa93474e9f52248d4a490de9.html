<h3>Data elements in the DHIS2 Customization Practice database</h3>
<p>If you go to the data element management page in the Maintenance app, you will see that there are already some existing data elements in your system. This includes data elements that belong to RMNCAH programs and will be used as references in demonstrations and activities. These data elements are here for your reference; you can review their names and properties within the list in the Maintenance app, but you won't be able to delete or modify them.</p>
