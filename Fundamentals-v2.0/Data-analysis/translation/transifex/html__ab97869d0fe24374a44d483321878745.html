<p>Dashboards are a <strong>collection of outputs or visualizations</strong>, such as pivot tables, charts, maps or reports that are typically grouped together because of a specific topic, program or theme. For example, you can create a dashboard for immunizations to show important outputs and visualizations about immunizations. You can share this dashboard with other DHIS2 users or user groups or print it to share it with people that don’t have access to DHIS2.</p>
<p>In the following videos, you will learn how to navigate the dashboard interface and identify the steps to create, edit and share your own.</p>
