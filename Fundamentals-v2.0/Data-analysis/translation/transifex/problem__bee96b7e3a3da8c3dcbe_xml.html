        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>When a dashboard is selected, it is highlighted in green making it easy to identify which dashboard you are currently viewing. Dashboards are listed alphabetically, not by the date which they were created. The height of the control bar can be expanded by clicking on the small down arrow. The control bar includes all dashboards that are available to you (either through your account permissions or because it was shared with you) rather than all dashboards available within the instance. </p>
