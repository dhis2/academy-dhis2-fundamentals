        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>When you log in to DHIS2, you will either see your most recently viewed dashboard or the first starred dashboard (depending on if you used the same computer when logging back in to DHIS2). When you create a dashboard in DHIS2, you need to share the dashboard with any users or user groups who need access to the dashboard. Dashboards are not automatically shared.  When creating a dashboard, you can resize and rearrange items by dragging and dropping them to the desired location or size. </p>
