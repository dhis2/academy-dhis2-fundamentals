<h3>Lab</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>graded assessment</strong> lab and it is worth <strong>15%</strong> of your final grade.</p>
<p>In order to answer the assessment lab questions, you will have to complete a task in the DHIS2 training instance, <strong>Trainingland</strong>. Sign in to your Trainingland account using the following link: <a href="https://academy.aggregate.dhis2.org/analysis" target="_blank">DHIS2 Analysis</a></p>
<p>You will have between <strong>1 and 3 attempts</strong> to answer each question correctly, and the lab passing grade is 80%. You will find the number of attempts permitted by question next to the Submit button. </p>
<p>If you want to save your current response without submitting it for grading yet, select the "save" button. This allows you to come back later and resume the attempt.</p>
