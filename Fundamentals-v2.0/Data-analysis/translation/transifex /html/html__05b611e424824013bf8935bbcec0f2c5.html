<h3>Welcome to Aggregate Data Analysis in DHIS2</h3>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Aggregate Data Analysis in DHIS2</strong> course, part of the <strong>DHIS2 Fundamentals</strong> courses program. In the Introduction to DHIS2 course, you gained an overview of DHIS2 and how it can be used to handle large amounts of data from various sources and formats, generate visualizations, and make informed decisions. In this course, we will explain how to use DHIS2 tools to create data visualizations to analyze aggregate data, and how to share visualizations with other users to foster discussions and decision-making.</p>
<p>In this module, you’ll find an overview of the course, and find the most important information to get started.</p>
<h3>What is this course about?</h3>
<p>Once data are captured from different sources, how can you use those data to create pivot tables, charts and maps? How can you edit a visualization and share it with other users? How can you collect related data visualizations and present them in a user-friendly manner? The Data Analysis in DHIS2 course will address all these questions and more, as you learn how to create, edit and share data visualizations using the DHIS2 Data Visualizer app.</p>
<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
<p>After completing this course, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a visualization from the Data Visualizer app</li>
<li>Identify the steps to create and edit a pivot table</li>
<li>Identify the steps to create and edit a chart</li>
<li>Identify the steps to create and edit a map</li>
<li>Identify the steps to create and edit a dashboard</li>
<li>Add descriptions and interpretations to outputs (pivot tables, charts, maps) for data analysis and sharing</li>
<li>Use dashboards to read, analyze and share information</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the course prerequisites?</h3>
<p>You need to complete the Introduction to DHIS2 course before starting this course.</p>
<h3>How is the course structured?</h3>
<p>Aggregate Data Analysis in DHIS2 has of 5 modules of content, an introductory module and a closing and next steps section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 0</strong>: Start here (30 min)</li>  
<li><strong>Module 1</strong>: Key concepts of data analysis in DHIS2 (20 min)</li>
<li><strong>Module 2</strong>: Using pivot tables for data analysis (2 hr)</li>
<li><strong>Module 3</strong>: Analyzing charts to make informed decisions (1 hr 30 min)</li>
<li><strong>Module 4</strong>: Creating and analyzing maps (1 hr 30 min)</li>
<li><strong>Module 5</strong>: Using and sharing dashboards (60 min)</li>
<li><strong>Course closing and next steps (10 min)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>How will I learn?</h3>
<p>In each module, you will find the content presented in text or <strong>videos of approximately 5-7 minutes in length, followed by step-by-step activities and ungraded knowledge check questions</strong>, where you will be able to interact with a training DHIS2 system and explore the platform. At the end of Modules 2, 3, 4, and 5 you will find mandatory graded quizzes composed by a random selection of questions from the knowledge check questions you have previously seen in the module and some new questions. Modules 2, 3, 4 and 5 also contain assessment labs where you will be asked to perform tasks in the DHIS2 training instance. You can get more information about these labs in the introduction of those modules. To earn the course certificate, you’ll need to pass the module quizzes and assessment labs.</p>
<p>You can watch the videos at your leisure or download them to watch later. You can also use the speed button to control the pace of the videos or the transcripts provided if you need them.</p>
<h3>How long will it take to complete the course?</h3>
<p>We estimate the course will take approximately <strong>6 hours</strong> to complete. This includes the review of all videos and completing the ungraded and graded sections. As this is a self-paced course, this may vary slightly for each learner.</p>
<h3>How do I pass the course?</h3>
<p>The course consists of 2 types of assessments that contributes to your final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> at the end of each module, you will find quizzes composed of multiple choice, multiple response, and/or true or false questions that will assess your comprehension of the main concepts behind DHIS2. You will have between <strong>1 and 3 attempts</strong> to answer each question correctly, and you will need an overall 80% score or higher to pass the quizzes. You will find the number of attempts permitted by question next to the Submit button. The quizzes contribute to <strong>40%</strong> of your final grade.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment labs</strong>: in Modules 2, 3, 4 and 5 you will be asked to perform specific tasks in a DHIS2 training instance. After completing those tasks, you will have to answer multiple choice questions to assess your comprehension of the exercise. These assessment labs contribute to <strong>60%</strong> of your final grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the third course in the DHIS2 Fundamentals course program, which also contains the <strong>Introduction to DHIS2, Data Capture and Validation in DHIS2</strong>, <strong>DHIS2 Customization,</strong> and <strong>DHIS2 Events Fundamentals</strong> courses. If you are interested in getting a higher level of training on DHIS2, you will find information about Level 1 Academies at the end of the course.</p>
<h3>How can I check my progress?</h3>
