        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>In a chart, you can drag and drop the dimensions to change its layout and how data is displayed in the visualization. To show districts in the series, the organisation unit dimension needs to be in the series section of the layout. In addition, to best display this data and compare data across locations, you should select a chart that allows you to compare sizes of related elements, like column or bar chart</p>
