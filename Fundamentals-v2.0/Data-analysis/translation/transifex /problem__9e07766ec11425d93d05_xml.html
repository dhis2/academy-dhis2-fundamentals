        <p>Different charts are better at communicating different types of data. When selecting your visualization type from the dropdown menu, the description under each chart name can help to guide you in the best chart type to use for your data. The column and bar charts can be used to compare sizes of related elements. The line chart is useful for tracking and comparing changes over time. The pie chart is helpful for comparing parts of a whole at a single point in time. </p>
