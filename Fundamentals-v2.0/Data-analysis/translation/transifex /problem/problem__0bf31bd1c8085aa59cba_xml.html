        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>Filters are applied to each dashboard item in the same way. You can apply filters to a dashboard that will change the data displayed in each dashboard item. The filter overrides the original value for that dimension in the original visualization. Filters can be applied directly in dashboards, you do not need to apply the filter within the application where it was created. It is possible to filter on period, organisation unit and other dynamic dimensions depending on the DHIS2 instance. </p>
