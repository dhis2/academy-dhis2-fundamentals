        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>If you want to add granularity to the data analysis, stacked bar and stacked column charts are well suited visualization types for disaggregations. When adding a disaggregation to a visualization that is already built, you will need to modify the layout to include a disaggregation in the layout area. Under “Your Dimensions” you will need to select the disaggregations for age and sex and add them to the visualization. You cannot add disaggregations through the Options button or Style tab. </p>
