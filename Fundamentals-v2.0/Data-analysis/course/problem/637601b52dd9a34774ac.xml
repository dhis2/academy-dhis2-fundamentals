        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p>You can reorder layer cards by clicking on the 6-dots icon in the upper left-hand corner of the layer card, and dragging and dropping it to the desired position. In this example, when the boundary layer is placed below the thematic layer, the district names fade into the background and become difficult to read. To easily view the district names, the boundary layer needs to be the top layer card (above the thematic layer).</p>
