<h3>Course closing</h3>
<p>You have now finished the DHIS2 Aggregate Data Analysis Fundamentals course. You should now be able to use the DHIS2 Data Visualizer app to create and edit pivot tables and charts, as well as the Maps app to visualize your aggregate data using maps. You should also be able to use dashboards to visually present the most relevant visualizations related to a topic and share these dashboards with other users to foster discussion and improve decision-making.</p>
<p>Remember, even though you have completed the course you are able to return to it to access this self-paced course again in the future, so if you get stuck or need to revisit a concept or demonstration, just come back to the DHIS2 online academy and review the course.</p>
