After discussing it with the course team we have decided to add a second attempt for each question with 3 or more options.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we allow partial credit for questions with checkboxes rather than pass/fail. We hope that this will allow you to improve your grade for the course to a passing one. Best of luck!</p>\n\n<p>The DHIS2 Online Academy course Team</p>",
