6. You will now see a thematic map with BCG coverage. In the thematic card layer, analyze how the thematic intervals display the data in the map

    1. How many intervals are there? What is the range of each interval? How many data values are there in each interval?

7. Let’s **edit** the thematic layer and change the classification to ‘Equal counts’ since it is better suited for our data item, which is counts rather than measurements

8. Click on the **pencil icon** in the layer card to open the dialog and return to the **Style tab**

    1. Under **classification**, select **‘Equal counts’**

    2. Select **‘Update layer’**

9. You will now see a thematic map with BCG coverage with equal counts. How do these intervals differ from the ones previously seen with equal intervals?

10. Let’s continue to edit the style of the thematic layer. Select the **pencil icon** in the layer card to open the dialog and return to the **Style tab**

    1. Select the **predefined color legend**

    2. **Legend set:** EPI - coverage

    3. Click ‘Update layer’

11. Now you can see the legend with 5 classes, their classification and color scheme.

12. Since the thematic layer is higher up in the layer order than the boundary layer, the district names are no longer visible in the map. Drag and drop the boundary layer above the thematic layer

13. You’ve successfully added a thematic layer to your map, showing BCG coverage by district in Trainingland for 2020

### 5.1 Orientation to dashboards (15 min)

#### What are dashboards?

What are dashboards in DHIS2? From the previous modules, you’ve already seen how you can open pivot tables, charts and maps using the context menu within a dashboard. When users sign in to DHIS2, it’s the first screen users see in DHIS2.

![Graphical user interface, application, Excel Description automatically generated](media/image7.png)

*Image 1 - A dashboard in DHIS2*

Dashboards are a **collection of outputs or visualizations**, such as pivot tables, charts, maps or reports that are typically grouped together because of a specific topic, program or theme. For example, you can create a dashboard for immunizations to show important outputs and visualizations about immunizations. You can share this dashboard with other DHIS2 users or user groups or print it to share it with people that don’t have access to DHIS2.

In the following videos, you will learn how to navigate the dashboard interface and identify the steps to create, edit and share your own.

#### Orientation to dashboards

Dashboards allow DHIS2 users to easily gather, interact and share key information about a program or topic in one centralized location. In this video, you will learn about the dashboard interface and discover its main features.
