</h5>

<ol>
<li>Sign in to <strong>DHIS2</strong> <strong>Trainingland (Entry)</strong></li>
<li>Open the <strong>Data Entry app</strong> from the Apps Menu</li>
<li>Select your <strong>Dimensions:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Select a facility level <strong>Organisation Unit</strong></li>
<li>Select a <strong>Data Set</strong> from the dropdown menu</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Period</strong> of your choice</li>
</ul>
<li>Enter an <strong>invalid data value</strong> such as <strong>text</strong>, <strong>characters</strong> or <strong>decimals</strong>. What kind of error message do you receive? What is the required <strong>value type</strong> of the data element?</li>
<li>Use the information provided in the error message to correct the data value. Enter some additional valid data values in the form in one or more sections</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Run validation</strong> button at the bottom of the data set</li>
<li>Are there any validation errors? Are any of the data values too high or too low for the data elements? What operator is shown in the expression? Use the information provided in the validation results to correct the errors then run the validation again</li>
<li>Once your data set has passed validation, select the <strong>Complete button</strong> to mark the data set complete. A dialog box will appear asking you to confirm the data set is complete, click ‘OK’</li>
<li>In order to see the <strong>timestamp</strong>, you will need to reload the data set. Take note of your organisation unit, data set and period so you can easily find your data set again. When you are ready, refresh the page and re-enter the dimensions of the data set. Can you find the timestamp? What information is included in the timestamp?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Explore DHIS2</h5>

<p>If you’d like additional practice in DHIS2, try these optional, exploratory steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Data Entry app, select a facility level organisation unit, the <strong>Malaria Burden Reduction</strong> data set and a period of your choice</li>
<li>Can you identify the <strong>two</strong> <strong>different values types</strong> used in this data set? How do the data entry fields differ? <strong>Hint</strong>: Look at the stock-out section of the form. What kind of data elements do you see? Can you find the Data Element Information Box?</li>
<li>Explore different data sets, organisation units and periods. Can you find a data set that has been marked complete? What is the timestamp? Would the data set be considered on time?</li>
</ol>
