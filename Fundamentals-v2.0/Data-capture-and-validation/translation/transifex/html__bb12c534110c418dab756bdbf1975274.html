<p><em>Image 1 - Importing data using the Import/Export app</em></p>
<p>What if you have a lot of historical data or a spreadsheet of data that needs to be added to DHIS2? Do you have to enter these data manually in DHIS2? The <strong>Import/Export app</strong> is another way to get data into DHIS2 without entering it by hand. The Import/Export app is used for <strong>importing metadata and data</strong> <em>into</em> DHIS2 and <strong>exporting metadata and data</strong> <em>from</em> DHIS2. However, this section will only focus on importing data.</p>
<p>To <strong>import data</strong> in the Import/Export app, you must select the <strong>Data Import</strong> tab. The app can import data values from multiple file formats including PDF, JSON, CSV, ADX XML and DXF 2 XML. You can select the file format and upload the file.</p>
<p>The app includes four options or <strong>strategies for importing data</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Merge:</strong> Import new values and update existing values</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Append:</strong> Import new values only</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update:</strong> Only update existing values, ignore new values</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove values included in the uploaded file</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, for large data imports, you can select the option to <strong>preheat the cache</strong> to make the large import process faster. There is also an option to <strong>skip the audit</strong>, meaning audit values will not be generated, as well as advanced importing options.</p>
<p>The app allows you to launch a “<strong>dry run</strong>” to test the import settings without importing any data. It is highly recommended to use the dry run option to test the import and check for problems. The app will show an import <strong>job summary</strong> with the results of the dry run, and any conflicts or errors displayed in the table under the import summary. After a successful dry run, indicated by a green completed label, data can be imported into the system.</p>
