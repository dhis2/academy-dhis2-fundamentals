<h5>Run a Batch Validation Rule Analysis:
</h5>

<ol>
<li>Sign in to <strong>DHIS2</strong> <strong>Trainingland (Validation)</strong> </li>
<li>Open the <strong>Data Quality app</strong> from the Apps Menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Validation Rule Analysis</strong></li>

<li>Select <strong>COVID-19</strong> as the <strong>validation rule group</strong></li>
</ul>
<li>Select <strong>‘Validate’.</strong> Note the results may take a few seconds to generate</li>
<li>Analyze the result of the Validation Rule Analysis</li>
<ul>
<li>What kind of validation rules are broken?</li>
<li>What is the level of importance for the validation rule?</li>
<li>Are there validation rules that are repeatedly broken?</li>
</ul>
<li>Select the information icon to find out more information about one of the validation rules</li>
<ul>
<li>What is the left side and right side of the validation rule expression?</li>
<li>What would the data value need to be for the validation rule to pass?</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h5>Explore DHIS2</h5>

<p>If you’d like additional practice in DHIS2, try these optional, exploratory steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Data Quality app, run a Batch Validation Rule Analysis for the Food Region for July 2021 (June 30th - August 1st, 2021) with the validation rule group: Immunisation rule group. What kind of validation rules are broken? Can you identify how the data values would be fixed for it to pass validation?</li>
<li>Run a Batch Validation Rule Analysis for a facility level organisation unit. Select a validation rule group and a period of your choice. Was validation passed successfully? If not, how many validation rules did it break?</li>
</ol>
