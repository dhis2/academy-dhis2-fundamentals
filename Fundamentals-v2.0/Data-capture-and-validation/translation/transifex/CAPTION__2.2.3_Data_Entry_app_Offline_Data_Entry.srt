00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,960
- [Narrator] What happens
when you are entering data

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,653
into DHIS2, but your
internet connection is lost?

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,580
This can be a common problem in places

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,033
with limited or unstable
internet connectivity.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,440
For this reason, DHIS2 has been built

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,400
with basic offline data
entry capabilities in mind

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,860
so you can continue to enter data

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,530
even when temporarily offline.

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,753
Let's take a look at how it works.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,090
When you open the DHIS2 data entry app,

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,420
the message, You are
online, should display

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,483
in a yellow text box at
the top of the screen.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,810
This means that you are
connected to the internet

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,020
and the data you entered
will be automatically saved

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,003
to the DHIS2 server.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,833
Now, let's see what happens
if you lose internet access.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,020
You can test this by turning
your internet connection off,

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,780
and then opening up a Data Entry form

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,210
and starting to enter data.

21
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,650
The message, You are offline,
data will be stored locally,

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,170
will appear at the top of the screen.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,930
You'll notice that when you enter data,

24
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,240
the field still turns green

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,450
to indicate the data value is saved.

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,600
This is because the data
are being stored locally

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
on your computer's cache.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,730
Let's turn the internet back on.

29
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,710
When the internet comes back on,

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,710
you will get another message that says,

31
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,000
There is data stored locally,
please upload to the server,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,820
with an Upload button next to the message.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,570
All you need to do is simply
click on the Upload button

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,670
and then you should receive the message,

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,133
Upload to server was successful.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,100
It is critical that you do
not clear your browser cache

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,940
using the DHIS2 Browser Cache Cleaner app

38
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,090
until you have uploaded
your data to the server,

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,280
as your data are stored locally

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,160
in your DHIS2 browser cache.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
Clearing your cache
before uploading your data

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,320
will result in data loss.

43
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,690
Note that the offline functionality

44
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,440
in the web-based DHIS2 data entry app

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,340
is intended to cover
periodic internet outages

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,030
and not to perform as a
permanent offline mode.

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,610
If you need to capture data in an area

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,670
where internet connectivity
is very limited,

49
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,860
or if you will be working temporarily

50
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,280
from an area with no
internet access at all,

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,630
we recommend using the
DHIS2 Android Capture app.

52
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,090
You will learn more about the Android app

53
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,040
later in this course.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
To recap, in this video,

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,490
you have learned that DHIS2
allows you to enter data

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,100
when the internet connection is not stable

57
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,820
by saving the data locally
in your browser cache.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,680
You will know when you are offline

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,530
by a message displayed on the screen.

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,600
When connectivity is restored,

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,360
you need to select a
button to upload the data

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,653
to the DHIS2 server.

63
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,088
