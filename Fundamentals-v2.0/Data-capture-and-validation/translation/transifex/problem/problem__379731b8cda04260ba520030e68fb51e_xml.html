        <p>All are correct. The complete button is useful for tracking when the data set was completed and allows the data to be analyzed in other DHIS2 apps for completeness and timeliness. A validation check is automatically run, notifying the user of any validation errors. Using the complete button is one of the tools for improving data quality in DHIS2. </p>
