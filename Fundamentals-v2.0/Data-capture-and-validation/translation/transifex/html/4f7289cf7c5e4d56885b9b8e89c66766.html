<h3>What is in this module?</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to input data into DHIS2 using the Data Entry app, what tools can you use to ensure that the data you have entered are correct? What is the easiest and best way to view the data?</p>
<p>In this module, you’ll learn about the different types of tools that can be used to view the data that you have entered in a meaningful way, alongside learning about how to ensure your data is of good quality. You’ll start by learning about validation rules and how to ensure your data is complete. You’ll look at two different data validation tools: the Batch Validation Analysis Tool and the Outlier Detection Tool. Finally, you’ll learn how to generate reports using the Reports app.</p>
<h4>Learning objectives</h4>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Data Quality app to run a batch validation test on aggregate data, check for outliers and check for data that is marked for follow-up</li>
<li>Use the Reports app to generate reporting rates and generate data set reports</li>
</ul>
<h4>How will you be evaluated?</h4>
<p>At the end of the module, you will find 2 graded activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quiz</strong>: 10 multiple choice, true or false, and drag and drop questions randomly selected from a question bank. You will have <strong>3 attempts</strong> to pass the quiz with a score of 80% or higher. This quiz contributes to 20% of your final grade.</li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment lab</strong>: you will be asked to perform specific tasks in our DHIS2 training instance. After completing these tasks, you will have to answer multiple choice questions to assess your comprehension of the exercise. This assessment lab contributes to 25% of your final grade.</p></li>
</ul>
