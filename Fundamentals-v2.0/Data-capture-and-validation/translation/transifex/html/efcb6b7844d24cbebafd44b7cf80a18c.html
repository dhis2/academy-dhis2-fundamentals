<h5>Explore DHIS2
</h5>

<p>If you’d like additional practice in DHIS2, try these optional, exploratory steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a data set</li>
<li>Select an organisation unit and period of your choice. For the organisation unit, try using a filter to narrow the results</li>
<li>Explore the various sections of the data entry form</li>
<li>Enter some very large data values in the form. When you save and check the data quality, what kind of error message do you get? Are you able to fix the errors from the information provided to you?</li>
<li>On the home page of your chosen data set, can you find your recent entry? Does it have a blue pencil icon or a green checkmark icon?</li>
<li>Explore the Malaria Burden Reduction data set to find different data element value types. Depending on the data element’s value type, a different data entry tool will appear when you are entering data for that data element. For example, a numeric data value type will bring up a number keypad on your device as the data entry tool. Can you find a data element with the value type other than numeric? How are the data entry tools different?</li>
