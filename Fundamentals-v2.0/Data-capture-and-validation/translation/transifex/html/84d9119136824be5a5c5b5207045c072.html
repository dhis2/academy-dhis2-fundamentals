<h3>Outlier Detection</h3>
<p>Data entry errors happen. During capture of aggregate data into DHIS2, a user may type a value that is much higher or lower than it should be, perhaps by adding an extra zero or entering a number in the wrong field. In some cases, these extreme values may be accurate and could indicate a deviation from the norm that should be investigated. These <strong>unexpected high and low values</strong> are called <strong>outliers</strong> and the <strong>Outlier Detection</strong> tool within the DHIS2 <strong>Data Quality app</strong> can help you identify them.</p>
