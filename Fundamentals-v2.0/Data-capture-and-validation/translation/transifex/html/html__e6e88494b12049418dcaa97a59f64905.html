<h3>Reports app</h3>
<p>The <strong>Reports app</strong> is a great tool within DHIS2 for <strong>viewing data entered for specific data dimensions</strong>. You can also look at <strong>data quality</strong> aspects of your data to check the data are complete and have been entered in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Once data has been entered in DHIS2, the Reports app can give you a more holistic view of the data by data set. This is useful for program managers to view all data entered for specific organisation units, periods and data sets. The Reports app contains numerous different reports, such as the Standard Report, Data Set Report, Reporting Rate Summary, Resource and Organisation Unit Distribution Report. In this module we’ll be focusing on two of these reports: the <strong>Data Set Report</strong> and the <strong>Reporting Rate Summary.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Data Set Report</strong> allows you to view your aggregated <strong>data by data set</strong>. The data in this report are <strong>aggregated by the Organisation Unit Hierarchy</strong>. For example, you can select a district and period within a data set, and the report will give you all the values from any facilities in the selected time period below that in the Data Set Report.</p>
<p>The <strong>Reporting Rate Summary</strong> shows you <strong>how many data sets</strong> have been submitted <strong>by organisation unit and period</strong>, allowing you to see how often data are updated and entered into your system. The Reporting Rate Summary is based on completed data sets (those that have the complete button pressed in the Data Entry app). There are five different parameters available from the Reporting Rate Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actual Reports</strong>, which are how many have been received</li>
<li><strong>Expected Reports,</strong> which are how many are expected to have been submitted</li>
<li><strong>Reporting Rates</strong>, which is the percentage of reports registered as complete based on the number expected</li>
<li><strong>Actual Reports on Time</strong> and <strong>Reporting Rate on Time</strong>, which each present the data based on a timeliness factor on when data sets were completed</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find out more about these parameters later in this module. Click next to continue.</p>
