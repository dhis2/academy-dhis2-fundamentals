<li>In the green dimension box, select your <strong>Dimensions:</strong></li>
<ul type="1">

<h5>Enter data and navigate a data set:
</h5>

<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the first field <strong>BCG doses given, &lt; 1 year</strong> and enter “2000” (two thousand) as the data value. After typing the data value in the field, press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard</li>
<ul type="1">
<li>What error message occurs? What color is the field?</li>
</ul>
<li>Since the data value is <strong>outside the predetermined range</strong> for this data element, the field turned <strong>orange</strong>. Update the data value to a value inside the predetermined range</li>
<li>Now that a valid data value has been entered, the field will turn <strong>green</strong> (indicating a valid value was entered and saved) and the next available field will be automatically selected</li>
<li>In the next field, enter a character such as the at sign (@) or an asterisk (*)</li>
<ul type="1">
<li>What error message occurs? What color is the field?</li>
</ul>
<li>Since the data value entered was invalid, the field turned <strong>yellow</strong>. Now enter a zero or positive integer as the data value in the field (if the number you entered is outside the predetermined range, simply update the data value to value inside the range). Now that a valid data value has been entered, the field will turn green (indicating a valid value was entered and saved) and the next available field will be automatically selected</li>
<li>Practice entering data and navigating through the data set using various navigation keys: use the <strong>Tab button</strong> to move to the next data field or <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> to move backwards. You can also use the <strong>up and down arrow keys</strong></li>
<li>Notice you are unable to enter data in the <strong>gray</strong> fields because data entry for those fields has been <strong>disabled</strong> and <strong>locked</strong></li>
<li>If you are working in a long data entry form or only need to enter data for a particular section, you can quickly navigate to the section using the <strong>Filter on Section</strong> feature in the green dimension box at the top of the data set. Use this feature to filter for the <strong>Adverse Events Following Immunisation</strong> section of the form</li>
<ul type="1">
<li>How does the data entry form change?</li>
</ul>
<li><p>Return to the Filter on Section feature and select <strong>‘Show all sections’</strong></p>
