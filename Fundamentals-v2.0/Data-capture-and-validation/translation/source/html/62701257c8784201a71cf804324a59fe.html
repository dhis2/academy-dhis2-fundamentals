<h3>Data Quality Review Framework</h3>
<p>Ensuring data quality is key in maintaining any form of HMIS and DHIS2 has a number of different tools to help you ensure good data quality standards. As you may recall from the Introduction to DHIS2 course, The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> (WHO) has a non-digital tool called the Data Quality Review Framework. The framework includes five data quality metrics that can be used to ensure good data quality:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Is all the data that needs to be there available?</li>
<li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Has the data been entered in a timely manner?</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Are the data within a plausible range from previous data collection exercises?</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Are the data consistent on repeated measurement?</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Does the data reflect the actual level of what is being collected?</li>
</ol>
<p>Using these metrics when entering data is a great way to ensure that your data is of good quality. To get started with this module and find out about data quality tools in DHIS2, click the next button below.</p>
