<h3>Welcome to Aggregate Data Capture and Validation</h3>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Aggregate Data Capture and Validation</strong> course, part of the <strong>DHIS2 Fundamentals</strong> courses program. In the Introduction to DHIS2 course, you gained an overview of DHIS2 and how it can be used to handle large amounts of data from various sources and formats, generate visualizations, and make informed decisions. In this course, we will address the first step necessary for this process to occur: data capture and validation.</p>
<p>In this module, you’ll find an overview of the course, and find important information to get started.</p>
<h3>What is this course about?</h3>
<p>Now you know what DHIS2 is, how do you get data into it? How do you ensure that the data entered are valid? Can you enter data offline? Can you enter data without using a computer? In this course, we will answer each of these questions, and show you how to enter and validate data into DHIS2.</p>
<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
<p>After completing this course, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the types of data you can enter into DHIS2</li>
<li>Enter data into DHIS2 using a web browser with the Data Entry app</li>
<li>Enter data into DHIS2 using an Android device with the DHIS2 Capture app</li>
<li>Enter data into DHIS2 while offline</li>
<li>Run a data validation test on your data</li>
<li>Complete a data set</li>
<li>Use the Data Quality app to run a batch validation test on aggregate data, check for outliers and check for data that is marked for follow-up</li>
<li>Use the Reports app to generate reporting rates and generate data set reports</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the course prerequisites?</h3>
<p>You need to complete the <strong>Introduction to DHIS2</strong> course before starting this course.</p>
<h3>How is the course structured?</h3>
<p>Aggregate Data Capture and Validation has 3 modules of content, an introductory module and a course closing and next steps section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 0</strong>: Start here (30 mins)</li>
<li><strong>Module 1</strong>: Key concepts for Data Capture and Validation (30 mins)</li>
<li><strong>Module 2</strong>: Data Entry in DHIS2 (2 hrs)</li>
<li><strong>Module 3</strong>: Validating your data in DHIS2 (2 hrs)</li>
<li><strong>Course closing and next steps</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>How will I learn?</h3>
<p>In each module, you will find the content presented in text or <strong>videos of approximately 5-7 minutes in length, followed by step-by-step activities and ungraded knowledge check questions,</strong> where you will be able to interact with a training DHIS2 system and explore the platform. At the end of Modules 1, 2, and 3 you will find mandatory graded quizzes composed by a random selection of questions from the knowledge check questions you have previously seen in the module and some new questions. Modules 2 and 3 also contain assessment labs where you will be asked to perform tasks in the DHIS2 training instance. You can get more information about these labs in the introduction of Modules 2 and 3. To earn the course certificate, you’ll need to pass the module quizzes and assessment labs.</p>
<p>You can watch the videos at your leisure or download them to watch later. You can also use the speed button to control the pace of the videos or the transcripts provided if you need them.</p>
<h3>How long will it take to complete the course?</h3>
<p>We estimate the course will take approximately <strong>5 hours</strong> to complete. This includes the review of all videos and completing the ungraded and graded sections. As this is a self-paced course, this may vary slightly for each learner.</p>
<h3>How do I pass the course?</h3>
<p>The course consists of 2 types of assessments that contributes to your final grade:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> at the end of each module, you will find quizzes composed of multiple choice, multiple response, and/or true or false questions that will assess your comprehension of the main concepts behind DHIS2. You will have between <strong>1 and 3 attempts</strong> to answer each question correctly, and you will need an overall 80% score or higher to pass the quizzes. You will find the number of attempts permitted by question next to the Submit button. The quizzes contribute to <strong>50%</strong> of your final grade.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment labs</strong>: in Modules 2 and 3 you will be asked to perform specific tasks in a DHIS2 training instance. After completing those tasks, you will have to answer multiple choice questions to assess your comprehension of the exercise. These assessment labs contribute to <strong>50%</strong> of your final grade.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the second course in the DHIS2 Fundamentals course program, which also contains the <strong>Introduction to DHIS2, Data Analysis in DHIS2</strong>, <strong>DHIS2 Customization,</strong> and <strong>DHIS2 Events Fundamentals</strong> courses. If you are interested in getting a higher level of training on DHIS2, you will find information about Level 1 Academies at the end of the course.</p>
<h3>How can I check my progress?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to check your progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course completion</strong>: Each time you log into the platform, you will see your completion rate, which represents the percentage of content you have reviewed so far.</li>
<li><strong>Course grade</strong>: Shows your current score based on the graded activities you have passed. You can check your course grade by clicking the Progress tab in the upper menu. To get the course certificate, you must reach at least 80% of the course grade.</li>
</ul>
