<h3>Data models and entry apps</h3>
<p>In the Introduction to DHIS2 course, you looked at the three different data models that exist in DHIS2: aggregate, event and tracker. You also got an overview of the different applications that are used to enter data for each of the models: Data Entry app for aggregate data, Capture app for event data, and Tracker Capture app for tracker data.</p>
<p>For a review of these data models and associated data entry applications, review the video <a href="https://youtu.be/o5Mf4dQiBik" target=none><u>How data are entered in DHIS2</u></a> from the Introduction to DHIS2 course.</p>
<h4>Aggregate data model</h4>
<p>The aggregate data model in DHIS2 is the most common type of data held within DHIS2 â€“ it is what DHIS2 was built on originally. The type of data captured is an <strong>aggregated sum of values.</strong> For example, you could capture data on the <strong>total number of individuals</strong> who were immunized in a month at a particular health facility. These data would be entered into DHIS2 through the <strong>Data Entry application</strong>.</p>
<h4>Event data model</h4>
<p>Event data is another type of data that can be entered into DHIS2. Event data captures <strong>anonymous individual events</strong>. For example, a public health team is recording cases of malaria in a district. They are simply trying to <strong>track the number of infections, and not the names of those who have been tested</strong>, as they are <strong>not providing follow-up</strong> support to those individuals. Event data are entered using the <strong>Capture application</strong>.</p>
<h4>Tracker data model</h4>
<p>Tracker data are similar to event data, in that they both capture data related to an individual or entity. However, <strong>unlike event data,</strong> <strong>you are able to track services provided to that individual or entity over time</strong>. Data about the entity are first registered into DHIS2, then DHIS2 allows you to add subsequent data to that entity over time. The entity can repeatedly be reopened to add further data. For example, imagine a newborn child born at a hospital facility. The midwife to the child creates a new Tracker record to capture their initial key information, such as name, weight and sex. As the child grows and the parents take the child to a local facility to benefit from a vaccination program, the doctor can enter details of the vaccinations given into the tracker database on the child's immunization schedule. Tracker data are captured through the <strong>Tracker Capture application</strong>.</p>
