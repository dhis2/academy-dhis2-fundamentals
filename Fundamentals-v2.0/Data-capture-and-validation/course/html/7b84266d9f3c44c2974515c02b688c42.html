<h4>Module Summary</h4>
<p>You have now reached the end of the third module for the Data Capture and Validation course. In this module, you have learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data quality:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Data elements have different value types</li>
<ul>
<li>While primarily numerical, data elements can also be text, check boxes or date ranges, for example</li>
<li>Entering an invalid value type will cause a data element to turn yellow and you will receive a notification at the top of your web browser informing you that your value type is incorrect</li>
</ul>
<li>The Run Validation button performs a validation check on data entered into the Data Entry app</li>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the Run Validation button will run a validation rules check, configured for the elements within the data set</li>
<li>Any errors will be identified within the data set</li>
</ul>
<li>The Complete button submits a data set as complete to the DHIS2 server</li>
<ul>
<li>Select Complete at the bottom of the Data Entry form when you have finished entering data into a data set</li>
<li>You will be notified of any validation errors in the data set</li>
<li>You can still edit the data after it has been marked as complete</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Batch Validation Rule Analysis:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Validation can be run on aggregated organisation units</li>
<ul>
<li>Select the Validation Rule Analysis from the Data Quality app</li>
<li>Set the organisation unit, period and validation rule to check, then select ‘Validate’</li>
<li>Check any errors that appear</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Outlier Detection:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Outlier Detection finds outliers from aggregated data in DHIS2</li>
<ul>
<li>Select the Outlier Detection from the Data Quality app</li>
<li>Select the data set, organisation unit and time period you want to check for outliers</li>
<li>Select the detection method and maximum number of outliers then select start</li>
<li>The resulting table will show any outliers detected, based on the detection method you have chosen</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Follow-Up Analysis:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Follow-Up Analysis can check to see any data in your selected data set has been marked for follow-up</li>
<ul>
<li>Open the DHIS2 Data Quality app and select Follow-up Analysis</li>
<li>Select the data set, organisation unit and time period you want to check for follow-up</li>
<li>Click the Follow-Up button</li>
<li>Review the chart showing the data selected for follow-up</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Reports app:</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Reports can be generated about data entered in the Data Entry app</li>
<li>The Data Set Report can generate reports about specific data sets</li>
<ul>
<li>Open the Reports app and select the Data Set Report</li>
<li>Select the data set and other dimensions you want to run a report for</li>
<li>Select if you want to just view the data of the specific organisation unit and not all the organisation units that report into it</li>
<li>Click ‘Get Report’</li>
<li>You will then be able to review the Data Set Report</li>
</ul>
<li>The Reporting Rate Summary keeps a track of data based on when the complete button submitted the data set as complete to the server</li>
<ul>
<li>Open the Reports app and select the Reporting Rate Summary</li>
<li>Select the dimensions you want to run a report for</li>
<li>Select if you want to just view the data of the specific organisation unit and not all the organisation units that report into it</li>
<li>Click ‘Get Report’</li>
<li>You will then be able to review the Actual Reports, Expected Reports, Reporting Rate, Actual Reports on Time and Reporting Rate on Time that appear</li>
</ul>
</ul>
