(mellow music)

1
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,340
- DHIS2 is a product

2
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,633
of the Health Information Systems Programme known as HISP.

3
00:00:21,893 --> 00:00:25,540
HISP is a global action research network

4
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,647
initiated jointly by the University of Oslo

5
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:31,210
and the University of the Western Cape

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,460
in South Africa in 1994,

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,520
with funding from the Norwegian Agency

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,753
for Development Cooperation, Norad.

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,190
As a result of the HISP collaboration,

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,510
the District Health Information Software or DHIS,

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,350
was launched in South Africa in 1996,

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,950
starting in one district and becoming

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,270
their national standard health information system in 1999.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,430
From its initial conception,

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
the core aim of DHIS2 has been to support local management

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,980
of healthcare delivery and information flow

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,773
in low and middle income countries.

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,150
To that end, we share our software,

19
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,693
DHIS2 globally as a digital public good.

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,640
The original DHIS software

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,630
functioned using local offline databases,

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,990
but this resulted in challenges in aggregating

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,680
and sharing data,

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,623
as well as scaling up implementations over time.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,750
As a result, in 2004,

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,130
development of a web-based DHIS2

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,830
began at the University of Oslo.

28
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,810
As DHIS2 is web-based,

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,060
users can enter and access their data

30
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,473
anywhere with internet connectivity.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,390
This model is still being expanded upon today

32
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,390
as DHIS2 incorporates the latest web-based technologies

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,510
to improve DHIS2&#39;s performance,

34
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,880
and increase its functionality.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,250
This includes offline data entry for areas

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,070
with internet connectivity challenges,

37
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,170
and the incorporation of a mobile application

38
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,143
for Android devices.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,560
The first implementation

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,560
of the web-based DHIS2 software was launched in 2006

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,583
in Kerala, India.

42
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,870
In 2009, DHIS2 added components that allowed

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,970
for the collection of individual data.

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,130
This was in direct response to requirements in Kerala,

45
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,400
where prospective mothers were tracked

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,660
through their anti-natal care services.

47
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,100
This individual data model

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,803
eventually evolved into DHIS2 Tracker.

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
2007, saw the first implementation of DHIS2 in Africa,

50
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,770
starting with Sierra Leone.

51
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,610
This was followed in 2010 by Kenya, then Ghana,

52
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,513
Rwanda and Uganda.

53
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,020
In 2011, the DHIS2 Academy training program began.

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,210
The University of Oslo in collaboration with HISP groups,

55
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,280
offers regional DHIS2 academies every year

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,903
on key DHIS2 topics.

57
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,010
Since 2017, the university has also run

58
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,890
the DHIS2 Online Academy,

59
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,273
which provides online courses for self-paced studying.

60
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,610
In 2012 and 2013, adoption of DHIS2 as a national platform

61
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,270
for routine health information continued in Africa,

62
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,860
Asia, and Latin America, was support from Norad,

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,383
the global fund and PEPFAR.

64
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,950
In 2014, the HISP network assisted health authorities

65
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,300
in Liberia in deploying DHIS2 Tracker

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,360
for the Ebola outbreak response.

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,540
With the support

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,310
of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,390
the Gates Foundation, Gavi, and other partners,

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,320
the initial tracker models deployed in Liberia,

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,720
have since been expanded upon for case-based surveillance

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,363
of other diseases, including COVID-19.

73
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:55,110
In 2015, DATIM was launched,

74
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,953
a PEPFAR specific version of DHIS2.

75
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:03,420
DATIM is used by PEPFAR in more than 50 countries.

76
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,001
DATIM continues to be one of the largest examples

77
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:11,370
of a global data warehouse within DHIS2.

78
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,210
Sharing standards and collating subnational HIV data

79
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,673
routinely across large and varied geographies.

80
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,790
In 2007, UiO became an official World Health Organization

81
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,500
collaborating center for innovation

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,490
and implementation research

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,463
for health information system strengthening.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,913
This collaboration led to the metadata package concept;

85
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:44,480
a method of sharing best practice configuration

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,810
and functionality developed by DHIS2

87
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,793
and health subject matter experts.

88
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
2018, saw the DHIS2 community of practice launch,

89
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,620
providing an online portal to help the community

90
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,730
of DHIS2 practitioners to connect with each other

91
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,563
and share best practice globally.

92
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,240
2019, saw DHIS2 being piloted

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,600
as an Education Management Information System

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,750
in the Gambia and Uganda,

95
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,170
extending the use of DHIS2 into the education domain

96
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,890
for school and infrastructure management,

97
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,133
student tracking and more.

98
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:34,370
In 2020, DHIS2 was quickly adopted

99
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,710
to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

100
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,760
The University of Oslo worked with the HISP network

101
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,500
to launch COVID-19 metadata packages

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,820
that allowed countries to rapidly

103
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,010
implement case-based surveillance, contact tracing,

104
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,563
and ports of entry programs.

105
00:06:55,643 --> 00:07:00,470
In 2021, new metadata packages were released

106
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,560
to support the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines,

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,330
based on previous work,

108
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,230
developing the DHIS2 immunization toolkit

109
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,920
with the support of WHO, UNICEF,

110
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,343
and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,880
DHIS2 continues to evolve,

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,880
thanks to the work of the core DHIS2 team and HISP network.

113
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,220
The support of our international partners

114
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,130
and the input of the global DHIS2 community,

115
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,930
who helped sustain DHIS2 as a global public good,

116
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,630
that can adapt to meet the health information needs

117
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,463
of the future.

118
