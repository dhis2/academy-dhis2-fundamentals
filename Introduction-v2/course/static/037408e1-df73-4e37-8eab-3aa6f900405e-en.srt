00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,810
- [Instructor] In this video,

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,750
we&#39;ll look at how you can navigate your course

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,740
in the DHIS2 Online Academy,

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,220
where you&#39;ll access your learning materials

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,383
so you can master DHIS2.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,260
Once you&#39;ve signed up for the course on academy.dhis2.org,

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,453
you&#39;ll see the list of courses you&#39;re enrolled in.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,713
Next, select a course and launch it.

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,210
You will be greeted with the course page.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,053
On the left, you will find the overview of the course.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,740
You can select any module to expand it

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,503
to view the subsections and units,

13
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,880
or you can select expand all

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,123
to view the detailed contents at once.

15
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,620
On the right side under the Course Tools,

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,743
you will find a link to the course updates.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Make sure you check this.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,593
There may be important news.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,580
Underneath you&#39;ll find any useful links,

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,100
such as links to the course Participant&#39;s Guide

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,933
and links to the registration page.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,590
On the bottom right-hand side,

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,550
you will find information about how to contact support

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,150
in case you need technical assistance,

27
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,703
or help with the course.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,200
You can start learning

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,023
by selecting a unit from the course overview,

30
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,870
or by selecting the Start Course button

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,763
in the top right corner.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,470
If you&#39;ve already begun the course,

33
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,753
you&#39;ll instead see the Resume Course button.

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,420
Each time you log in,

35
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,793
you&#39;ll come back to the subsection you were last in.

36
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,040
When you resume the course,

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,050
you will have the detailed course overview on the left

38
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,803
next to the learning material.

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,170
Know that each subsection,

40
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,890
such as unit 1.3 practical information

41
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,340
can contain several units each

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,173
represented by a tab on the top.

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,853
You can move between each of these by selecting the tab,

44
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,850
or simply by using the left and right arrows

45
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,253
to navigate between the pages.

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,880
At the end of each module,

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,003
you will find a feedback form.

48
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,400
We would love to know what you think of the course

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,390
so that we can use your feedback

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,003
to improve our future courses.

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,920
At the very top of the page,

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,743
you can find additional tabs related to your course.

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,550
In this instance, Course, Discussion,

54
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,440
Progress, Frequently Asked Questions,

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,153
and Participant&#39;s Guide.

56
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,000
We&#39;ve already explored the course panel,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,383
so now let&#39;s look at the discussion panel.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,660
Here, you can interact with your fellow learners

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,573
as well as your trainers.

60
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,320
You can create a new post by selecting Add a Post

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,653
in the top right.

62
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,943
First, choose if it&#39;s a discussion or a question,

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,623
and find a relevant topic area.

64
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,293
Now you are ready to write your question.

65
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,933
Make sure you include a descriptive title too.

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,453
When you are ready to post, select submit.

67
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,070
You can look at posts by other students

68
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,293
and facilitators by browsing in the left-hand box.

69
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,370
In the progress tab,

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,973
you can see how far you&#39;ve progressed through the course.

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,670
At the top of the page,

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,160
you&#39;ll see a bar chart that shows how well you&#39;ve done

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,603
in each of the graded activities.

74
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,593
And at the right of the chart, you can see a total amount.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,490
In order to pass the course,

76
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,533
you&#39;ll need to get at least 80%.

77
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,300
If you scroll down, you can see an overview

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,700
of each of the modules and their sections,

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
as well as the scores that you&#39;ve achieved

80
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,053
for the activities in the sections.

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,000
And finally, the FAQ tab is where you can find answers

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,490
to the most common questions,

83
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,593
for example, about grading and getting course certificates.

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,440
And the Participant&#39;s Guide,

85
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,400
which gives a detailed overview of the course

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,403
and practical information.

87
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,430
And that&#39;s it.

88
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,083
We hope you enjoy this DHIS2 Academy course.
