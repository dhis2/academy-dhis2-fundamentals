      <p style="font-size:16px;">Dashboard is typically the first thing users see when they log into DHIS2 so it’s especially useful if users need quick access to information. Typically, a dashboard contains a collection of outputs regarding a specific topic or a program. The data that are shown in a user’s dashboard depends on their own level of access. Interpretations can be made through the dashboard.
