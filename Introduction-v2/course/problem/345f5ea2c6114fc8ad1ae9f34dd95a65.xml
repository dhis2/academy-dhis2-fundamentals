      <p style="font-size:16px;">Relative periods such as “last year”, “last month”, and “last six months,” are not defined in an absolute sense but rather in relation to the current date. The key difference between fixed and relative periods is that a fixed period does not update automatically over time for an analytic object; whereas a relative period will show new data as we move ahead with time.
