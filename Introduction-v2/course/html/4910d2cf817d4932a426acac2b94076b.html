These concepts have remained constant since DHIS2â€™s initial development and are therefore still relevant and being actively utilized within the system. By reviewing and understanding the foundations we present within this course, you will be well on your way to start understanding advanced concepts associated with DHIS2. I hope you will find the course content, activities and training environments engaging. I look forward to interacting with you all throughout the course and within the broader DHIS2 community.</p>
