<h3>Components of the DHIS2 ecosystem</h3>

<p class="text">DHIS2 is more than just a piece of software. As you’ve learned, it is a community effort that wouldn’t be possible without the people who research, develop, implement, localize and use the platform. This community effort is facilitated by a range of initiatives, programs, platforms and tools that make up the DHIS2 ecosystem.</p>
