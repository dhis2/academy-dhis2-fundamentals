<h3>Discussion forums</h3>

<p class= "text">The <a href="https://academy.dhis2.org/courses/course-v1:DHIS2+00001+2021Q2/discussion/forum/" target="_blank">discussion forums</a> give you an opportunity to communicate and discuss ideas with the course staff and your fellow students. We encourage you to participate in these forums to learn from your peers and discuss course material.</p>
<h3>General forum guidelines</h3>
<p class= "text">You are invited to use the discussion spaces throughout the course to connect with your peers and share your questions and ideas.</p>
<p class= "text">The use of the discussion forums is an <strong>optional activity</strong> and is not graded.</p>
<p class= "text">Tips for using the discussion forums:</p>
<ul>
<li class= "text"><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Share your opinions and ideas and respect the opinions of others.</li>
<li class= "text"><strong>Help each other</strong>! Reply to your peers’ questions and comments.</li>
<li class= "text">Actively <strong>up-vote</strong> other posts if you think they are relevant, and other people will up-vote yours! The more up-votes your post has, the more likely it is to be seen.</li>
<li class= "text">Choose the appropriate <strong>category</strong> when posting; this will keep the discussion forum orderly.</li>
<li class= "text">Use a <strong>descriptive and specific</strong> title for your post. This will attract the attention of other learners with the same issue.</li>
<li class= "text">See if someone <strong>has already asked your question</strong> before creating a new post.</li>
<li class= "text">Use “<a href="https://elearningindustry.com/10-netiquette-tips-online-discussions" target="_blank">netiquette</a>” or common writing practices for online communication. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class= "text">Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.</li>
<li class= "text">Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p class= "text">Pro-Tips</p>
<ul>
<li class= "text">If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it in the future, you can <strong>follow it</strong>. To do that, view the post you want to follow and select the “Follow” icon.</li>
<li class= "text">Each post that you follow appears with a “Following” indicator in the list of posts. To list only the posts that you are following, regardless of the discussion topic they apply to, select the drop-down “Discussion” list and select “Posts I’m Following”.</li>
</ul>
<p class= "text">To make this an enjoyable, positive, and constructive experience for all, participants are required to be respectful. Abusive and disrespectful communications <strong>will be removed</strong>. You can help by reporting misuse. You can flag any post, response, or comment for a discussion moderator to review: view the contribution, select the “More” icon, and then select “Report”.</p>
