1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,801
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:26,041
- I'm Khadija from HISP: Tanzania.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,310
- My name is Zeferino
Saugene, I'm from Mozambique.

4
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,603
- My name is John Lewis
from HISP: Vietnam.

5
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,830
- My role is as a system analyst,

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,760
but as well as a teachers
to implement that.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,210
- I am coordinating the team
a foreign community that told

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,520
us is Mozambique, which is
also called and so Digitas.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,720
- I'm a director now for his
Vietnam leading the adjust

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,650
to implementation in Southeast
Asia and Pacific Islands.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,840
- I heard about DHIS2 when I
was in my university studies,

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,300
started engaging myself,
went around asked about it,

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,570
and at least they were cooperative enough,

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,550
shared me the link, DHIS2 to fundamentals.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,360
And I started to learn more about it.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,050
And I would say everything
started from there.

17
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,327
- I think started I getting
involved with this group in 2003

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,690
in the master program.

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,300
And then I went to Oslo in August,

20
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,420
stayed there for one year.

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,070
And then we come back to Mozambique

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,690
and then I had one hour field work

23
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,060
and then start writing and
then finalize it in 2005.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,750
- 2000 When I was interviewed
for as a software developer

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,430
to join his India project and
one of the small constancy

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,263
in India.

27
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:49,053
So I was appointed as a
system developer for DHIS21.

28
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,300
- As the DHIS2 team,

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,750
we managed to support
our ministry of health

30
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,030
in implementing the DHIS2 country-wise

31
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,390
and it's the key system that
is used to by the minister

32
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,220
of health in Tanzania in data collection

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,127
and of course boarding.

34
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,670
- The DHIS, I'm a conference
is the event where we,

35
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,623
there is a lot of sharing experience,

36
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,500
and then a lot of users,
implementers, donors,

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,240
they attend then we get there

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
and then we share all our experience

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,020
from the implementation side.

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,410
And also from the user perspective.

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,560
- When we started HISP
India I was the only person

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,240
and then like three group
to the national level

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,511
for the entire country.

44
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:35,300
I guess that that was
the key event for me.

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,130
We take a small NGO operating
in a very small constancy

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,150
in one particular village to
move to the national entity

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,793
and working with the
Indian ministry of health.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,100
- A lot, honestly speaking,

49
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,070
because since I've started using it,

50
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,410
or since I started knowing about it,

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,280
it has proved to be a very
very flexible platform.

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,580
It was initially aimed just
for health information systems.

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,760
We managed to extend beyond healthy,

54
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,830
but even using it in agriculture
sector, as well as water.

55
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,948
So I would say it's a
very flexible platform

56
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:19,330
and it can support a number of use cases.

57
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,681
As we have had different use
cases from different countries,

58
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:27,341
- HISP is a family we have
been supporting many countries

59
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,690
and then when I get to know several people

60
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:36,180
they share the same challenges.

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,440
For example, as in
Mozambique, then we will,

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,050
we go and we find that same
challenge and you find that you

63
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,170
will also find it in countries
like the Guinea-Bissau

64
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,010
or Sao Tome.

65
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,710
So it has been to me it is
a community., it's a family.

66
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,720
- For me, it's an ideology,

67
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,720
which basically thinks about
how best we can try to use

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,460
informal system in the health
settings and how best we can

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,100
try to get the right tool
to white people and DHIS2

70
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,690
what we believe is a tool which helps

71
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,000
the health administrators and people

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,740
to make a decision at the local level.

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,206
And as well as the national level.

74
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:18,789
(upbeat music)
