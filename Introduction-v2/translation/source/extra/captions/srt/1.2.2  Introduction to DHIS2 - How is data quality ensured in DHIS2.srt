2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,320
- [Instructor] Once we have
data entered into the platform,

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,903
how can we check the data's
accuracy and reliability?

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,640
In this video, we will
explore several tools

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,360
in the DHIS2 data quality app
that will help us to review

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,093
and improve the quality of our data.

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,030
First, in the data quality app,

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,170
you can run a validation rule analysis

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,850
which tests validation rules

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,783
against the data registered in the system.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,680
After running the check,
you will get a report

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,240
with a list of data
that need to be checked.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,100
For example, if we look at the first row,

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,040
our validation rule says
that the value of registered

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,630
for the third anti-natal
care visit, or ANC,

16
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,000
can not be higher

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,350
than the value registered
for the second ANC visit.

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,760
But the value registered for ANC3 is six,

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,580
while the value for ANC2 is four.

20
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,090
We can follow up with this location

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,870
to determine the specific
source of the error.

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,080
Note that you can also run
the validation rule analysis

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,593
during the data entry process.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,770
The standard deviation outlier analysis

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,360
is another tool we can
use to check data quality,

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,910
identifying those values
that are potential outliers

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,470
when compared to the
standard normal distribution

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,453
of the data under review.

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,170
Like in the validation rule analysis,

30
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,360
when we run a standard
deviation outlier analysis,

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,820
we get a report with all the
data that need to be checked.

32
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,160
For example, in this row,

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
the data indicate that only
five BCG vaccines were given

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,260
in this health facility.

35
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,080
This value of five

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,660
falls outside the normal
distribution of these data,

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,903
and it has been identified as
a potential source of error.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,250
Another tool is the
min-max outlier analysis,

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,320
which checks if the data are
within a predefined range

40
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,133
that has been specified for them.

41
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,470
This lists the values that are
out of this predefined range.

42
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,720
We can see in the example,

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,720
a value of 45 AEFI suspected cases,

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,050
which is out of the range

45
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,133
of a minimum of zero to a maximum of 22.

46
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,800
The fourth and last tool
available in the data quality app

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,760
is the follow-up analysis tool.

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Follow-up analysis creates
a list of all data values

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,113
marked for follow-up.

50
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,450
We can mark a data value for
follow-up in the data entry app

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,610
and the data quality app

52
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,810
via the reports from the
standard deviation outlier

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,483
and min-max outlier analysis tools.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,780
This is an example of the report obtained

55
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,473
after running followup analysis in DHIS2.

56
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,080
In coordination with WHO,

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,790
a data quality tool for
DHIS2 has been created.

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,740
This app generates
findings on data quality

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,463
following WHO's data
quality review framework.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
This includes completeness.

61
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,920
That is, if all the
expected data are recorded,

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,870
timeliness, or if the data
were received on time,

63
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,240
internal consistency,

64
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,720
which compares internally
submitted data with one another,

65
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,150
and external consistency,

66
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,703
which compares the data with
other sources, such as surveys.

67
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:37,537
As an example, we can
review internal consistency.

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,660
The WHO data quality tool

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,320
allows us to identify
outliers within our data.

70
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,470
We can see an example
of this in District C-1,

71
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,070
where the number of measles
vaccines given in January, 2020

72
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,550
is much higher in comparison
to the other values reported

73
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,100
within the same district in the same year.

74
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,250
This helps us easily visualize

75
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,850
what data need to be double-checked

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,593
before running any analysis.

77
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,720
In summary, in DHIS2,

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
there are several tools

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,170
that help us to check the
quality of the data entered,

80
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,330
such as validation rules,

81
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,530
standard deviation outlier analysis,

82
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,260
minimum-maximum outlier analysis,

83
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,731
and follow up analysis.

84
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:43,130
DHIS2 and WHO have also collaborated

85
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,710
to create a data quality tool

86
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,450
that runs checks to validate completeness,

87
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,450
timeliness, internal consistency,
and external consistency.
