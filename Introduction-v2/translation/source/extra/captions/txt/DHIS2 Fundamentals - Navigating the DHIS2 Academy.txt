- [Instructor] In this video, we'll show you how to use the key features of the DHIS2 online Academy platform. Once you've logged into the Academy and selected your course, you'll be greeted with the course page. Right below the course title, you'll see any messages from the course team. Then you will see the course menu where you can click on a module to view the subsections and units or expand all to view the outline of the entire course. You can start the course by selecting a unit from the course overview or by selecting the start course button in the top right corner. If you've already begun, you'll instead see the resume course button. Every time you log in, you'll launch at the subsection you were last in. Once in, you'll have the detailed course overview on the left, next to the course material. The blue underscored subsection is where you currently are. You can move between the course content using the previous and next buttons at the top and bottom of the page. If you've completed a unit, you'll see a green check mark. To answer knowledge check questions or graded quizzes, you'll need to select the answer and click the submit button. When the show answer button is enabled, you can click on it to check the right answer. At the very top of the page, you'll find additional tabs related to your course. The most important is the progress tab where you can check on how you're getting on through the course. The FAQ tab is where you'll find answers to common questions about things like grading and getting course certificates. Finally, you'll find the participant's guide, which gives a detailed overview of the course and practical information. And that's it. We hope you enjoy this DHIS2 Academy course.
