*   False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can combine data from multiple data sources. This includes through routine data that is directly collected within the system you are working as well as supplementary data from other sources such as surveys.



2. The HISP network works collaboratively on advancing the features which DHIS2 supports
*   **True**
*   False

EXPLANATION

The HISP network is a world-wide collaboration that supports the development of the DHIS2 project. Collaboration between the nodes is a key area of interest to ensure that DHIS2 continues to meet local needs as defined by its users.


### 2.2 Introduction to Trainingland (10 min)


#### Video - Introduction to Trainingland

How are you going to learn to use DHIS2? We believe that the best approach to learn a new tool is by using it through hands-on activities in a safe environment.

That is why we created Trainingland, a DHIS2 training environment that represents a fictional country where you will find all you need to work with DHIS2 features and become familiar with the capabilities we will discuss in this course. Watch the following video to get an overview of Trainingland, and the next steps you need to take to start practicing with it.

### 2.3 The 1000 Most Vulnerable Days’ Use Case (7 min)


#### Video - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

To better understand how DHIS2 can help us to collect, aggregate, and analyze data in a public health context, we are going to use the example of the 1000 **M**ost **V**ulnerable **D**ays (MVD’s) use case, which is aimed at preventing childhood deaths by making informed decisions.

This use case will allow you to see how using DHIS2 will help you to **track different health programs** for mothers and children, the **health services** they receive, and see how the collected data inform **their progress**.

In this video, you will start to get familiar with this use case, which we'll use throughout the course.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4)

**Knowledge check** (not graded) - The 1000 MVD's Use Case



1. The 1000 most vulnerable days use case covers:
*   From the time the child is born up until 3 years of age
*   From the time the child is conceived up until 2 years of age - correct
*   From the time a mother receives antenatal care and completes her post-natal care

EXPLANATION

The 1000 most vulnerable days covers both infant and mother from the time from when the child was conceived to the child’s 2nd birthday. This is a critical time for child development; the right nutrition for the mother and for the child during this time can have a profound impact on the child's growth and development and reduce disease risk, as well as protect the mother's health. Elements linked to this use case are used throughout this academy.



2. This use case is used to help us define: (select one or more)
*   The services that are provided to the mother and child
*   The data we collect in relation to those services
*   The outputs we create in relation to those services

EXPLANATION

All 3 of these items are used to translate elements of the use-case (in this case, a health-related use case) over to DHIS2. It is important to identify what the key inputs and outputs are; this is often best accomplished by understanding the use-case in detail.


### 2.4 Overview of DHIS2 (15 min)


#### Video - Overview of DHIS2

In this overview, you will begin to familiarize yourself with some of the key elements of DHIS2 that we will delve into throughout the course.

First, you will see options that allow you to **customize **your experience with the platform. 

Through examples, you will see the **different types of data** (numerical, anonymous, or individual data) that can be collected, and the **reports **that can be obtained.

Lastly, you will begin to hear about the 3 applications that we will see in detail later on: Pivot Tables (used to create dynamic tables), **Data Visualizer** (used to make charts) and **GIS** (use to make maps) based on the data stored in the platform.

Note: GIS is currently called Maps starting with DHIS2 version 2.29

**Knowledge check** (not graded) - Overview of DHIS2



1. We can collect different types of data directly within DHIS2 (for example, aggregate data or anonymous individual-level data)
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can collect different types of data directly within the application. This includes aggregate data, event data (anonymous, individual level data) and “Tracker” data (identifiable, individual level data).



2. We can configure data quality checks by creating user-defined validation rules which check the data that is entered
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Mathematical rules, referred to as validation rules, can be defined by a user in order to check the data that is being entered. This is one of electronic methods checking data quality in DHIS2 and will be discussed further in other sessions.



3. We can define the variables that we are collecting directly through the DHIS2 user-interface
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

As mentioned in the demo, it is a key principle of DHIS2 to allow the user to customize what they are collecting directly through the user-interface.



4. The outputs we create can not be given additional descriptions/interpretations directly within DHIS2
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

We can provide all of our outputs with additional descriptions and discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2. This allows us to give the item more context for when other users are reviewing the information and will be discussed further in the analysis sessions.



5. The analyses/outputs that we create can not be shared with other users directly within DHIS2
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

The analyses/outputs that are created can be shared with other users directly within DHIS2. This will be discussed more in later sessions.


### 2.5 DHIS2 Building Blocks (7 min)


#### Video - DHIS2 Building Blocks

All data that is recorded in DHIS2 has at least **3 dimensions** that describe it: _where_, which represents the geographic context and is called the "**organisational unit**"; _what_, that is, what is the raw data that we are collecting and is called "**data element**"; and _when_, that is, the "**period**" in which the data is collected.

These are the building blocks of the DHIS2 data model, and are key to understanding how the platform works.
