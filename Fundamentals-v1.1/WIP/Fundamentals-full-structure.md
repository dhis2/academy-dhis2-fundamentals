[[embed the pre-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1dbVONTc2NZTAIif3mtCjcONcjo8alHbs-knCD4_rhINC4A/viewform?usp=sf_link)]


### 1.1 About the course


#### Welcome to DHIS2 Fundamentals

We are excited you have joined us for this course on DHIS2 Fundamentals! 

Here in module 1, youâll find an overview of the course, get familiarized with the Open edX platform, and find the most important information to get started.


##### What is this course about?

Throughout this course, you will learn the essentials of DHIS2, an open-source information system that facilitates decision making within a wide variety of sectors thanks to its wide range of data capture, review, analysis, and sharing capabilities. In this course, we will be using public health for all of our examples, but note that DHIS2 is also used in other sectors such as environment and education.


##### What will I learn?

After completing this course, youâll be able to:



*   Describe how DHIS2 can be used to aggregate, analyze, review, and share data from health programs.
*   Describe the key concepts, building blocks, and terminology of DHIS2.  
*   Create pivot tables, charts, and maps to visualize data within DHIS2.
*   Identify the initial steps to customize DHIS2 for aggregate data to meet the needs of a given country or organization.
*   Differentiate the mechanisms used for data capture within DHIS2 along with their main features


##### What are the course prerequisites?

There are no specific prerequisites to do this course. However, having basic knowledge or prior experience using data analysis tools (such as Microsoft Excel) is an advantage.


##### How is the course structured?

DHIS2 Fundamentals is comprised of 6 modules:



*   **Module 1**: Overview and Getting Started (45 min)
*   **Module 2**:  Introduction to DHIS2 (1 hr)
*   **Module 3**:  Introductions to DHIS2 Analysis (8 hr)
*   **Module 4**: Introduction to DHIS2 Customization (6 hr)
*   **Module 5**: Introduction to Tracker (3 hr)
*   **Module 6**: Summary Concepts (20 min)

In each module, you will find video presentations, demonstrations, knowledge check questions, and step-by-step activities to be developed in Trainingland (the training environment you will use along the course). 

We estimate you will need to invest approximately 20 hours to complete all the activities of the course. As this is a self-paced course, note that this may vary slightly for each learner.


##### What do I have to do to pass the course?

The course consists of both quizzes and assignments that contribute to your final grade:



*   40% assignments
*   60% quizzes

Youâll have 3 attempts to complete each assignment or quiz. In order to pass, an overall grade of 80% is required; in addition you will need to ensure all of the assignments in Module 4: Customisation are completed successfully. 

By passing this course, you will be able to take the Level 1 - Analytics Tools and Level 1 - Design and Customisation Academies (more information about Level 1 Academies is presented at the end of the course)


##### What should I do now?

If this is your first time in Open edX, go to the next unit to learn how to navigate the platform. If you are already familiarized with it, go to the unit âHow to get supportâ by selecting the menu on your left-hand side.

##### General Forum Guidelines

You are invited to use the discussion spaces throughout the course to connect with your peers and share your questions and ideas.

The use of the discussion forums is an **optional activity**, and is not graded.

Tips for using the discussion forums:



*   **Be respectful**. Share your opinions and ideas and respect the opinions of others
*   **Help each other**! Reply to your peersâ questions and comments.
*   Actively **up-vote** other posts if you think they are relevant, and other people will up-vote yours! The more up-votes your post has, the more likely it is to be seen.
*   Choose the appropriate **category **when posting; that will keep the discussion forum orderly.
*   Use a **descriptive and specific **title to your post. This will attract the attention of other learners with the same issue.
*   See if your question **has already been asked **before creating a new post.
*   Use â**netiquette**,â or common writing practices for online communication. For example:
    *   Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if that is not what you mean to convey.
    *   Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls donât rplce wrds w/#s).

PRO-TIP



*   If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it in the future, you can **follow it**: view that post and select the âFollowâ icon.
*   Each post that you follow appears with a âFollowingâ indicator in the list of posts. To list only the posts that you are following, regardless of the discussion topic they apply to, select the drop-down âDiscussionâ list and select âPosts Iâm Followingâ.

To make this an enjoyable, positive, and constructive experience for all, participants are required to follow the **Honor Code** and be respectful. Abusive and disrespectful communications will be removed for the comfort of all participants. You can help by reporting misuse. You can flag any post, response, or comment for a discussion moderator to review: view the contribution, select the âMoreâ icon, and then select âReportâ.

## Module 2 - Introduction to DHIS2 (1 h)


### 2.0 Overview of the module (10 min)


#### What is in this module?

What is DHIS2 and where does it come from? What are its **main features**? What are its **3 building blocks**? 

In this module, you will learn how DHIS2, as an open-source management information platform, is used in countries around the world for **reporting, analysis, and dissemination of data.**    

You will also start to get familiar with the main features of DHIS2 and its 3 building blocks. 

In section 2.2, you will be prompted to **create an account on Trainingland**, the training environment that we will be using along the course, which allows you to navigate DHIS2 and get hands-on experience with it. 

After each video, you'll find some **non-graded questions** that will help you check your knowledge. 

At the end of the module, you will find the **first graded assignment** of the course, which counts for 5% of your final score.

We estimate that you will take about 1 hour to view all the videos and complete all the learning activities, including the graded assignment.

### 2.3 The 1000 Most Vulnerable Daysâ Use Case (7 min)


#### Video - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

To better understand how DHIS2 can help us to collect, aggregate, and analyze data in a public health context, we are going to use the example of the 1000 **M**ost **V**ulnerable **D**ays (MVDâs) use case, which is aimed at preventing childhood deaths by making informed decisions.

This use case will allow you to see how using DHIS2 will help you to **track different health programs** for mothers and children, the **health services** they receive, and see how the collected data inform **their progress**.

In this video, you will start to get familiar with this use case, which we'll use throughout the course.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4)

**Knowledge check** (not graded) - The 1000 MVD's Use Case



1. The 1000 most vulnerable days use case covers:
*   From the time the child is born up until 3 years of age
*   From the time the child is conceived up until 2 years of age - correct
*   From the time a mother receives antenatal care and completes her post-natal care

EXPLANATION

The 1000 most vulnerable days covers both infant and mother from the time from when the child was conceived to the childâs 2nd birthday. This is a critical time for child development; the right nutrition for the mother and for the child during this time can have a profound impact on the child's growth and development and reduce disease risk, as well as protect the mother's health. Elements linked to this use case are used throughout this academy.



2. This use case is used to help us define: (select one or more)
*   The services that are provided to the mother and child
*   The data we collect in relation to those services
*   The outputs we create in relation to those services

EXPLANATION

All 3 of these items are used to translate elements of the use-case (in this case, a health-related use case) over to DHIS2. It is important to identify what the key inputs and outputs are; this is often best accomplished by understanding the use-case in detail.


### 2.4 Overview of DHIS2 (15 min)


#### Video - Overview of DHIS2

In this overview, you will begin to familiarize yourself with some of the key elements of DHIS2 that we will delve into throughout the course.

First, you will see options that allow you to **customize **your experience with the platform. 

Through examples, you will see the **different types of data** (numerical, anonymous, or individual data) that can be collected, and the **reports **that can be obtained.

Lastly, you will begin to hear about the 3 applications that we will see in detail later on: Pivot Tables (used to create dynamic tables), **Data Visualizer** (used to make charts) and **GIS** (use to make maps) based on the data stored in the platform.

Note: GIS is currently called Maps starting with DHIS2 version 2.29

**Knowledge check** (not graded) - Overview of DHIS2



1. We can collect different types of data directly within DHIS2 (for example, aggregate data or anonymous individual-level data)
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can collect different types of data directly within the application. This includes aggregate data, event data (anonymous, individual level data) and âTrackerâ data (identifiable, individual level data).



2. We can configure data quality checks by creating user-defined validation rules which check the data that is entered
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Mathematical rules, referred to as validation rules, can be defined by a user in order to check the data that is being entered. This is one of electronic methods checking data quality in DHIS2 and will be discussed further in other sessions.



3. We can define the variables that we are collecting directly through the DHIS2 user-interface
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

As mentioned in the demo, it is a key principle of DHIS2 to allow the user to customize what they are collecting directly through the user-interface.



4. The outputs we create can not be given additional descriptions/interpretations directly within DHIS2
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

We can provide all of our outputs with additional descriptions and discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2. This allows us to give the item more context for when other users are reviewing the information and will be discussed further in the analysis sessions.



5. The analyses/outputs that we create can not be shared with other users directly within DHIS2
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

The analyses/outputs that are created can be shared with other users directly within DHIS2. This will be discussed more in later sessions.


### 2.5 DHIS2 Building Blocks (7 min)


#### Video - DHIS2 Building Blocks

All data that is recorded in DHIS2 has at least **3 dimensions** that describe it: _where_, which represents the geographic context and is called the "**organisational unit**"; _what_, that is, what is the raw data that we are collecting and is called "**data element**"; and _when_, that is, the "**period**" in which the data is collected.

These are the building blocks of the DHIS2 data model, and are key to understanding how the platform works.

3. In DHIS2, data elements and indicators represent the same concept.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

In the building blocks presentation, it is noted that data elements and indicators represent different concepts. Data elements are the raw data, while indicators are calculated values.



4. Which of the following are data elements (select one or more)?
*   Number of maternal deaths 
*   Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000)
*   Number of positive malaria cases
*   Annual Malaria Parasite Incidence

EXPLANATION

The data elements are the raw data values that we collect. Calculated values such as ratios and incidences are considered indicators.

![alt_text](images/image35.png "image_tooltip")


*Brief Note: In this table, there should not be more Malaria RDT positives then Malaria RDT performed. If this is occurring, then there is likely some issue with the quality of the data. For example, in Afghan Dispensary for the period Oct - Dec 2015 in both the &lt; 5 and >= 5 age group, we can see that there are more Malaria RDT positives then Malaria RDT performed. Malaria RDT positives are a direct result of performing an RDT test to detect malaria, and therefore the number of Malaria RDT performed should always be >= the number of Malaria RDT positives. 

Question of the assignment 3.2.4 

In Blueberry dispensary, were the total number of Malaria RDT positives greater than or less than the total number of Malaria RDTs performed?

EXPLANATION

The correct answer is greater than

#### Video - GIS Demo Part 6 of 8 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to add multiple thematic layers to your map. Multiple thematic layers allow you to make comparisons of different data within the same map. This is particularly useful when you are trying to make correlations between various services you are measuring. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd7f8kM-jJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd7f8kM-jJo)


##### Activity 6 - Adding multiple thematic layers

To the map you have created in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), please add in a 2nd thematic layer and save the map as a favorite.



*   Start by selecting Thematic layer 2 -> Edit layer.



<p id="gdcalert81" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image81.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert82">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image81.png "image_tooltip")




*   Define the data and period selection for Thematic layer 2. Select the following:
    *   Value type: Data Element
    *   Data element group: Malaria
    *   Data element: Malaria RDT performed
    *   Period Type: Yearly
    *   Period: 2016



<p id="gdcalert82" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image82.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert83">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image82.png "image_tooltip")


In the organisation units tab:



*   Select "District" as the organisation unit level.



<p id="gdcalert83" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image83.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert84">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image83.png "image_tooltip")


In the options tab:



*   Ensure that your classes/method is similar to what you have defined for thematic layer 1. Using our current example, thematic layer 1 used 7 classes as well as equal counts as the method. We should therefore select the same options in thematic layer 2.



<p id="gdcalert84" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image84.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert85">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image84.png "image_tooltip")




*   Click on "Update" to see the map displayed with the 2 related layers.

You can move the items around and resize them to your liking in order to get a feel for how the objects on the dashboard work. This is a very useful tool for bringing together multiple analysis in a particular thematic area together in order to be reviewed quickly. It is particularly useful for program managers to receive at-a-glance information regarding the programs they are responsible for.

1. I have created a pivot table with the following dimensions:

- Data Element Group: Delivery

- Data Element: Births, Live

- Period: Last 4 Quarters

- Organisation Units: Trainingland Districts

In a real-life setting, a username will likely not be used to identify a favorite.

Which of the following is a good name for the favorite? (select one)



*   Live Births
*   Deliveries in Trainingland, last 4 Quarters
*   Live Births by Trainingland Districts, last 4 Quarters
*   Delivery_Live Births, Districts, last 4 Quarters

EXPLANATION

The naming convention for favorites should include the program name and the 3 core dimensions (what you are measuring, where it is coming from and when it is coming from). This option includes all of these aspects.



2. I want to do some analysis comparing all of the following:

- All Facilities within my organisation unit hierarchy

- The last 12 months worth of data

- A combination of two data elements and one indicator

Which tool(s) should I use to display this information? (select one or more)



*   This type of analysis is not possible in DHIS2
*   Data Visualizer
*   Pivot Table
*   GIS

The pivot table application is most suitable when you want to analyze multiple dimensions of data, including multiple organisation units, time periods and data types.



3. In DHIS2, I can add additional dimensions (such as Male/Female, Public/Private Facilities, etc.) to further break-down my data during analysis.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Data can be broken down into different disaggregations in analysis. This is shown in both the pivot table and data visualizer demonstrations.



4. If today's date is April 2, 2017 and I select a relative period of the last 5 years, which periods will be selected? (select one)
*   2011-2016
*   2012-2016
*   2013-2017

EXPLANATION

Relative periods work backwards from the current date. In 2017, if we go back 5 years we have 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.



5. Using the features in DHIS2 I can: (select one or more)
*   Move analysis seamlessly between pivot tables, charts and maps
*   Add descriptions to favorites to give them more context
*   Discuss interpretations of the favorites in the system with other users

EXPLANATION

The DHIS2 analysis tools allow you to move between the different applications, save outputs and add in descriptions and discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2.



6. Favorites can be shared: (select one or more)
*   Using specific privileges for each item (such as edit/view)
*   With other users within DHIS2
*   Directly from DHIS2 to social media

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as well as sharing sessions. This allows us to specify exactly who sees the outputs we have created.



7. With the DHIS2 dashboards you can: (select one)
*   Have multiple dashboards
*   Add favorites from analysis app
*   Share dashboards with groups of users
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Dashboards contain all the functionality discussed in this question. This was demonstrated during the dashboard demo.



8. What is the primary role(s) of dashboards? (select one)
*   Make data easily accessible
*   Make data easily communicable
*   Aid in decision making
*   Easily view data from multiple angles in one place
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Dashboards are useful in conveying a variety of different information together. This was demonstrated during the dashboard demo.



9. Sharing in DHIS2: (select one)
*   Is used to define which favorites can be seen by whom
*   Can be used to share dashboards with other users
*   Can be used to share interpretations with other users
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing can be used to customize the different outputs that can be seen by each user. This was best demonstrated during the sharing session.



10. Sharing is typically controlled by: (select one)
*   Selecting specific users in which to share objects
*   Selecting user groups in which to share objects
*   Sending items through messaging within DHIS2
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as well as sharing sessions. This concept uses user groups to define who can see which outputs and related information in the system.



11. Messages can be sent within DHIS2 to: (select one or more)
*   Individual users
*   User Groups
*   Users belonging to an organisation unit

EXPLANATION

The messaging feature was presented in the integrated analysis session. Here, any combination of the displayed answers can be selected in order to send messages.



12. Using Feedback in DHIS2: (select one)
*   The central team can manage questions, assign them priorities and update users on their status
*   Messages can be sent to other users within DHIS2
*   Interpretations of different analysis can be shared

EXPLANATION

The feedback feature was presented in the integrated analysis session. It is particularly useful for managing issues that users encounter with the DHIS2 system.


### 3.6 - Reports App and Reporting Rates (35 min)


#### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 1 of 4 (9 min)

In this series of videos, you will learn how to use the reports app, which contains a series of various reports that allow you to review information about your system in unique formats when compared to the 3 core analysis apps (pivot table, data visualizer, GIS). In the first video, you will learn about data set reports and resources within the reports app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyAfzvYpOBk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyAfzvYpOBk)


##### Activity 1 - Data Set Reports and Resources

In [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), please run a data set report. In order to access data set reports:



*   Go to Apps -> Reports -> Data Set Report



<p id="gdcalert122" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image122.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert123">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image122.png "image_tooltip")




*   Select the criteria for the data set report and click on "Get report" when ready. You can use the following as a guide:
    *   Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
    *   Period Type: Yearly
    *   Period: 2016
    *   Organisation Unit: Animal Region (you can try any org unit you like here)



<p id="gdcalert123" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image123.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert124">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image123.png "image_tooltip")




*   You will see the results for the dataset/period/organisation unit combination after you click on "Get report".

As discussed in the video, this gives you a layout of the data set as you would see it in data entry. You can not edit the data here however, and this can often serve as an ideal location to review the data in a format that users are familiar with. The data can be aggregated within this report, and therefore looked at within different levels of the hierarchy as required.



<p id="gdcalert124" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image124.png).

#### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 3 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to view reporting rates directly in the pivot tables app. Reporting Rates are readily available within the reports app, but you can also use the pivot tables app to review reporting rates in DHIS2. This gives us the advantage of being able to review multiple levels of organisation unit reporting rates in one place. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q)


##### Activity 3 - Reporting Rates in Pivot Tables

In [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), view the reporting rates within the pivot tables application. We will select all of the metrics associated with the "Primary Health Care Monthly Data Set".



*   In the data tab select:
    *   "Data Sets" as the data type
    *   Select the various metrics followed by "Primary Health Care Monthly" as related to that metric. For example, select the "Reporting Rates" metric type followed by the "Primary Health Care Monthly (Reporting rates)" metric. Repeat this for all metric types
*   Arrange the metrics youâve selected according to the order you want them displayed within the pivot table.



<p id="gdcalert135" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image135.png).

1. What does the data set report allow you to do? (select one)
*   Review data as it would appear in data entry and allow you to update/edit the data
*   Review data as it would appear in data entry without allowing you to modify it
*   Output the data as a user-defined one-click report

EXPLANATION

Data set reports were highlighted during the reports app demo. It is always a good idea to review data in the data set report rather than data entry as you cannot modify data in this report.



2. Resources in DHIS2 can be used to: (select one or more)
*   Upload items such as data collection forms, guidelines or annual reports
*   Add links to useful websites
*   Add additional assets that will increase DHIS2's performance

EXPLANATION

Resources were demonstrated in the reports app demo. Resources can be useful for uploading external documentation and links to external resources amongst other things. In this case, resources do not correspond with additional resources to power the DHIS2 system.



3. Organisation unit distribution reports can be used to: (select one or more)
*   Provide a total count of organisation units that appear at certain levels within the hierarchy
*   Display organisation units based on the groups they belong to
*   Show the geographic distribution of organisation units on a map

EXPLANATION

The organisation unit distribution report was demonstrated in the reports app demo. This allows us to separate our organisation units into user defined categories/groups as well as see the number of organisation units at different levels of the hierarchy.



4. In DHIS2, the reporting rate completeness can be checked in: (select one or more)
*   The reports app by running the reporting rate summary
*   Pivot Table, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in
*   Data Visualizer, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in

EXPLANATION

Reporting rates can be accessed in various parts of DHIS2. This includes in the reports app as well as the different analysis apps.

## Module 4 - Introduction to DHIS2 Customization (6 hr)


### 4.1 - Introduction to Collection and Customization (20 min)

Now that youâve had the opportunity to use DHIS2 with existing data, we would like to shift focus and show you how to set up DHIS2 to capture your own data. Youâll start by reviewing the **Design Principles** of DHIS2 so you can understand how DHIS2 works behind the scenes. Then, after watching demonstrations, you will  create **Organisation Units, **also known as our âwhereâ dimension**. Organisation Units** form the backbone of data collection as they associate all of the data you are capturing with a particular location. You will be able to create these in a new training environment, **DHIS2 Customization**. Next, youâll look at how to create **Data Elements **(our** â**whatâ** **dimension) These data elements define exactly what information we want to capture. After you have reviewed the creation of organisation units and data elements, you will review the various **Data Collection **mechanisms available in DHIS2. ** **Finally, youâll look at **Data Sets **within DHIS2**. Data Sets** are a collection of data elements and are assigned to certain organisation units. These are conceptually similar to a paper data collection form. You will have the opportunity to create a data set within the DHIS2 Customization training environment.

This module is graded, and successfully completing the module is required in order for you to gain your Fundamentals Certificate. This is because all of the Level 1 DHIS2 academies have some aspects of configuration or maintenance within their course content, so a basic understanding of this material is required for participation in those courses. The grading for this module is made up of **5 quizzes that each make up 5%** of your grade, in subsections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 & 4.6.** **There are also **3 assignments that each make up 8%** of your grade in subsections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 that need to be completed within the DHIS2 Customization training environment.


### **To make the most out of your learning experience, we recommend that you complete this module within a week of starting** it.**  **


#### Video - Collection and Customization Intro (3 min)

In this introductory video, you will review the concepts that we will be focusing on within this module. In this module, you will learn how to create your own sets of Organisation Units, Data Elements and Data Sets.

You will also review how to use the Web Data Entry App, the Android Data Capture App, SMS and PDF and other import options to upload data to DHIS2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqc-O4Z0dP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqc-O4Z0dP8)

### 4.2 - Design Principles (20 min)


#### Video - Design Principles Presentation (10 min)

As an open source platform, DHIS2 can be widely customized based on how a given system is structured in any given country. 

In this video, youâll learn about the 4 key design principles of DHIS2: 1) all metadata can be modified through the user interface; 2)  DHIS2 can act as a single data repository; 3) data input does not equal data output; and 4) the use of indicator-driven data analysis is encouraged.

##### Session Quiz - DHIS2 Customization (10 min)



1. DHIS2 is an off-the-shelf solution that requires no additional configuration upon installation.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

In both the DHIS2 History/Introduction and DHIS2 design principles presentation, it is highlighted that DHIS2 is a generic solution that needs to be tailored to fit local needs and requirements



2. You need to be a computer programmer (someone who knows computer languages) to take part in the configuration of DHIS2.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Many aspects of DHIS2 configuration can take place directly through the user-interface. This concept was discussed in the DHIS2 design principles presentation and demonstrated through numerous configuration sessions.



3. DHIS2 only supports the integration of data from one health program at a time.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Multiple programs can be integrated into the DHIS2 platform together. This is shown as both a concept and demo in the DHIS2 design principles session.



4. Reports in DHIS2 are dynamic and can be the combination of data from several different data sources.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Report can be a combination of data from multiple sources. This is shown in the DHIS2 design principles session.



5. What is the difference between Data Elements and Indicators (select one)?
*   They are both the same.
*   Data Elements measure the coverage while indicators collects data values from the paper forms
*   Data Elements are the raw data while Indicators are calculated values/formulas

EXPLANATION

The key difference here is that indicators represent calculated values, and can typically be made up of several data elements. Data elements are the raw items of data that are collected through routine processes.


### 4.3 - Organisation Units


#### Video - Organisation Units Presentation (6 min)

In this video, youâll be introduced to the  concepts of **organisation units, organisation unit groups** and **organisation unit group sets. **These form the backbone of our data collection as they assist in attaching geographical locations to each data item that is stored in the system. Some best practices in their management are introduced before discussing their creation in the next series of videos. ** **[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge5LjORD9Lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge5LjORD9Lg)


#### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 1 of 4 (15 min)

After understanding how organisation units, organisation unit groups, and organisation unit group sets are related, you will now learn **how organisation units are created within DHIS2**. This will also include an introduction to the maintenance app, which allows you to create various items (referred to as metadata) within DHIS2. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuI6BNUvho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmuI6BNUvho)


#### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 2 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to take the organisation units you have created and group them into **organisation unit groups**. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0hhs9dkj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0hhs9dkj4)


#### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 3 of 4 (4 min)

Once you have created your organisation units and grouped them using organisation unit groups, you can take on the last step, creating **organisation unit group sets.** This video will cover this last step. These 3 concepts combined can have a significant impact on how your data is stored (as defined by the** organisation units** themselves) and what types of outputs are possible (as **organisation unit groups **and **group sets** allow you to disaggregate your data depending on how they have been defined). 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwOx2qH_ClM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwOx2qH_ClM)


#### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 4 of 4 (4 min)

### Assignment - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets


#### NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4. (30 min)

This series of assignments consist of 3 sets and makes up **8% of your overall grade.**



*   
Set 1: Organisation Units


*   
Set 2: Data Elements


*   
Set 3: Data Sets
At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2) you will be asked to check whether you have completed the whole series of assignments or not. This check will allow the course team to validate the result of your assignments in the DHIS2 Customization training environment. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignments will be confirmed. As with all other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts to complete this assignment successfully.

Note: Before validation from the course team has been performed, the maximum grade for this series will be applied to your progress automatically. This unvalidated grade is only a placeholder value, and may change once the validation process is complete. 


##### Assignments Module 4 - Set 1/3 - Organisation Units

Instructions

You need to be logged in [DHIS2 Customisation](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action) to perform the following assignments.

You are tasked with creating a portion of the organisation unit hierarchy within your country. The data should be entered at the correct level so appropriate outputs can be created. The hierarchy in this example country has 4 levels:



1. Country
2. Province
3. District
4. Facility

You will notice that the Country level organisation unit has been created using your email address when you enter organisation unit maintenance. This is so that you will only see the organisation units that you are creating, rather than seeing everyoneâs organisation units together. Feel free to change the name of this organisation unit to something else if you desire.

![alt_text](images/image141.png "image_tooltip")


Please work on the following:


##### Assignment 4.3.1

Define and create the organisation unit.

Refer to the doc "[Exercise Worksheet - Creating Organisation unit](https://academy.dhis2.org/assets/courseware/0bc4e40bbec535044faf30bd8ffdcbd0/c4x/HISP/DHIS2_Level1/asset/Exercise_Worksheet_-_Creating_Organisation_units.pdf)". Create organisation units with the following organisation unit hierarchy.



*   1 org unit at level 2 (Province)
*   3 org units at level 3 (District)
*   9 org units at level 4 (Facility)


##### Assignment 4.3.2

Create 4 organisation unit groups with the following names (and belonging to the indicated group sets) and assign your above facilities (the organisation units you have made at level 4) appropriately:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie. SND_Hospital, SND_Health Center) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the groups with unique names. 

Group Set 1 : Facility Type



*   Hospital
*   Health center

Group Set 2 : Ownership



*   Private
*   Public


##### Assignment 4.3.3

Create two organisation unit group sets and assign them the appropriate organisation unit groups:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie. SND_Type, SND_Ownership) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the group sets with unique names. 



*   Type
*   Ownership


### Session Quiz - Organisation Units 

Session Quiz - Organisation Units (20 min)  

This is a graded quiz and it is worth 5% of your final grade. You have 3 attempts to pass this quiz.

Select the "check" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for grading, select the "save" button. This will allow you to come back later and resume the previously saved attempt.


##### Session Quiz - Organisation Units



1. Which one of these is not an organisation unit? (select one)
*   Ermita Public Health Centre
*   National Capital Region
*   Manila Hospital
*   Malaria Elimination Project

EXPLANATION

In the organisation units presentation, it is mentioned that multiple concepts should not be mixed in the hierarchy



2. The organisation unit hierarchy: (select one)
*   Can use organisation unit groups to model additional hierarchies (for example, public/private facilities) for analysis
*   Only supports a limited number of levels
*   Does not include any administrative layers outside of the facility

EXPLANATION

The concept of using organisation unit groups during analysis was shown during the organisation units presentation. These are user defined as was shown in the organisation unit demo.

Imagine you've created the following health facilities in DHIS2:

-Alberta Public Health Clinic

-Ontario Private Hospital

-Windsor Public Health Clinic

-London Public Hospital

As you can see there are two ownership types: private and public. There are also two facility types: clinic and hospital.

Now you want to create organisation units groups for these facilities. 



3. Which organisation unit groups would be best? (Select one or more)
*   Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public Hospital / Windsor Public Health Clinic
*   Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public Hospital
*   Publicly Owned Facilities: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health Clinic / London Public Hospital AND Privately Owned Facilities: Ontario Private Hospital
*   Publicly Owned Facilities: Windsor Public Health Clinic / London Public Hospital AND Privately Owned Facilities: Ontario Private Hospital / Alberta Public Health Clinic

EXPLANATION

In this case, we can group the public health clinics and hospitals together. This would be equivalent to defining the type of facility within a system. We can also group public and private facilities together, which would be equivalent to defining the ownership of these facilities. This was discussed during the organisation unit presentation.



4. When managing organisation units in DHIS2 through the user interface, we can define the following geographical features: (select one or more)
*   Latitude/Longitude (for example, the location of a facility)
*   Geographical Symbols that define groups
*   Geographical Boundaries for regions, provinces, districts, etc.

EXPLANATION

This was shown when demoing the creation of organisation units. We can add in lat/long coordinates of a facility during creation, and assign symbols to organisation unit groups.


### 4.4 - Data Elements 


#### Video - Data Elements Design Principles  (12 min)

In this video, you will review the different types of data that can be collected in DHIS2, including what we refer to as  routine, semi-permanent and infrastructure data. You will also understand why it is important to **name data elements correctly; **this will include a review of best practices to follow when naming your data elements** **. Lastly, youâll see how to create data element groups and group sets.

##### Session Quiz - Data Elements



1. Data Element names should: (select one)
*   Be as long and descriptive as possible
*   Use self-contained names which describe the data effectively for output
*   Replicate the name on a paper form
*   Be considered for input as a priority

EXPLANATION

When discussing data elements, we should always consider how they will appear in output. This is discussed in more detail during the data elements presentation.



2. I have a section of data elements that I am collecting all related to child delivery. I want to create the data element represented by the "Number of deliveries with complication" on the paper form. What is the most appropriate name for this data element? (select one)
*   Number of deliveries with complication
*   Complicated deliveries
*   Deliveries with complication

EXPLANATION

During the data element presentation, naming principles were discussed. Here, since we have a set of delivery data elements, it is better to start the name off with "Delivery" as all the delivery types could easily be found together in a list.



3. Data elements in DHIS2 can only be summed (added) together. No other operations, such as finding the average or counts of a particular value, can be performed.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

When creating data elements, we can define various aggregation types. While sum tends to be a common option, other types can be used if needed.



4. Data Element Groups are used for grouping together similar data elements for thematic analysis.
*   True

EXPLANATION

Data element groups are user defined and assist us in finding our data elements during analysis. Their use was shown throughout all the analysis apps and their creation was shown in the data element creation session.


### 4.5 - Data Collection


#### Video - Data Collection Presentation (13 min)

The previous sets of assignments have allowed you to practice creating organisation units and data elements. Prior to creating a data set, we will demonstrate the different options that allow you to bring data into DHIS2, including the Data Entry Web application, the Android Data capture App, SMS Data Entry, PDF Data Upload, and Manual Data Import. The data entry web app, android data capture app and SMS data entry all use the concept of a dataset, which we will show you how to create after you have reviewed various data collection mechanisms in more detail.

#### Video - Data Collection - Web - Part 1 of 5 (5 min)

In this video, youâll learn how to input data into DHIS2 using the Data Entry Web application. We will use the 3 building blocks in this session, selecting **Where **the data is entered, **When **the data is entered, and **What **data is being entered.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIeWvibXZOw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIeWvibXZOw)


##### Activity 1 - Introducing the data entry app interface

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).

Familiarize yourself with the web data entry interface by opening a data set, navigating the data set and entering some data values. In order to open a data set you must first select the organisation unit, data set and period that you would like to review.



*   Select any organisation unit by either using the magnifying glass or expanding the tree on the left side of the screen.



<p id="gdcalert142" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image142.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert143">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image142.png "image_tooltip")


The organisation unit that you select will be highlighted in an orange color. It will also be displayed as the selected organisation unit in the data entry pane.

After you have selected an organisation unit:



*   Proceed to select a data set (in this example we will use the Primary Health Care Monthly data set)
*   and Period (select a period in 2018 such as January 2018 or March 2018 as these periods currently do not have any data; use the "Next year" button to select periods in 2018).



<p id="gdcalert143" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image143.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert144">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image143.png "image_tooltip")


After selecting these parameters the data set will be displayed. Note: If you select an organisation/period that already has data entered in it already for 2018, try selecting a different organisation unit or period in which no data has been entered.



<p id="gdcalert144" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image144.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert145">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image144.png "image_tooltip")




*   Enter the following practice data for the first section of the data set (labelled "Primary Health Care Monthly") to get a feel for using the data entry app. You can quickly navigate within the data entry app by using enter or tab to move forward/down and shift+tab to move backward/up between the various data element values when entering your data. Notice that when you enter values they will quickly change from yellow to green indicating they have been saved.



<p id="gdcalert145" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image145.png).

![alt_text](images/image145.png "image_tooltip")



#### Video - Data Collection - Web Demo - Part 2 of 5 (7 min)

In this video, you will see some additional options available when entering values using the Data Entry Web App. This includes checking the internal consistency of your data values through reviewing historical values as well as using a concept called validation rules and reviewing what changes have been made to your data using the audit trail. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq5SN-nCYpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq5SN-nCYpM)


#### Activity 2 - Reviewing the data element history, audit trail and validation rules

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).

Start this activity by running validation for the data that you have previously entered according to the example data provided in Activity 1:



*   You can select "Run validation" at either the top or bottom of the data entry page.



<p id="gdcalert146" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image146.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert147">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image146.png "image_tooltip")


When you run validation, a pop-up screen will prompt you that some validation rule violations have been detected.



<p id="gdcalert147" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image147.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert148">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image147.png "image_tooltip")


This includes:



*   Birth live >= Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery: the amount of infants that are breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery is a subset of the total live births within a facility. Therefore live births should always be greater than or equal to the number of infants breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery.
*   Delivery by Caesarean Section &lt;= Delivery by skilled birth attendant: Caesarean Sections are a subset of total deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant.
*   Delivery with complication &lt;= Delivery by skilled birth attendant: Deliveries with complication are a subset of total deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth attendant.

Let us fix these validation rules before continuing.



*   Update the following data elements to fix the issues with validation. In this case, we could imagine some simple data entry errors occurring. In the first example (Birth live) a 6 was entered instead of a 9. In the second example (Delivery by skilled birth attendant) the 7 was not entered at the end of the data value.



<p id="gdcalert148" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image148.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert149">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image148.png "image_tooltip")


After you have edited the values:



*   run the validation again. This time, you should see a successful result.



<p id="gdcalert149" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image149.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert150">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image149.png "image_tooltip")




*   Double click on the value for Birth live (194) after you have corrected it.

This will bring up the data history page for you to review.



<p id="gdcalert150" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image150.png).

##### Activity 4 - Offline data entry

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).



*   To perform offline data entry, disconnect from the internet.

DHIS2 will prompt you indicating "You are offline, data will be stored locally".



<p id="gdcalert157" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image157.png).

![alt_text](images/image157.png "image_tooltip")




*   Try navigating around and selecting different organisation units at the facility level.

You can also change between the different data sets and periods. Note that you will not see any data that is only stored online; therefore most of the organisation unit/data set/period combinations you select will not display data until you are back online.



*   Enter some data in offline mode for the primary health care monthly data set using a period in 2018 as you did before for the Immunization section of the form.



<p id="gdcalert158" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image158.png).

##### Activity 2 - Entering data offline using an Android device

In order to start this activity, you must first ensure you are logged in to the android device with your internet connection active. If you try to log-in without an internet connection it will not work.

After you have logged in:



*   Turn off the wi-fi and mobile data on your phone to ensure you no longer have any connectivity.



<p id="gdcalert176" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image176.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert177">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image176.png "image_tooltip")


Now you can proceed to:



*   select an organisation unit/period/data set combination

##### Practice Zone

Knowledge check (not graded) - PDF and CSV Import

PDF forms can be automatically generated by DHIS2 in order to enter data offline



*   True
*   False

    DHIS2 can natively import an Excel file in any format

*   True
*   False

    DHIS2 has functionality to import large amounts of data at once so this data does not need to be re-entered again

*   True
*   False


### Session Quiz - Data Collection


#### NOTE: THIS IS A GRADED QUIZ.

You are allowed 3 attempts for this quiz.

There is 30 seconds of time between each attempt, so if you don't get it right, just breathe in, watch the videos once more and carefully read the question again.


##### Session Quiz - Data Collection

The main function of Data Sets in DHIS2 is to: (select one)



*   Create dynamic outputs
*   Group together data elements for analysis
*   Capture Data
*   Analyse data quality

EXPLANATION

Data Sets are used to capture data from different sources in DHIS2. Outputs are not directly tied to data sets and can be a mix of different data sets as needed.

Some different methods for me to input data using DHIS2 include: (select one or more)



*   Performing a manual import of data
*   Using an Android Device
*   Scanning Data directly from a paper form
*   Using the data entry app within DHIS2

EXPLANATION

Different types of data collection methods were shown throughout Module 4. DHIS2 does not have the ability to scan in results from a paper form directly however.

In the web data entry app, you can view the following: (select one or more)



*   Data element history (referring to the history of a particular item)
*   Audit trail (showing you changes made to a particular item)
*   The distribution of the data over a particular period, such as variance or standard deviation

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 does allow for you to examine data distributions such as variance and standard deviation, but this cannot be done directly in the data entry web app. The audit trail and data element history were shown in the data entry web app session.

In the web data entry app what type of quick quality checks can be performed? (select one or more)



*   That individual minimum and maximum limits are not violated
*   Validation rules that run user defined conditions which check that certain logical, mathematical criteria are met
*   That values are being entered in the correct format (ie. text cannot be entered in a numerical field)

EXPLANATION

In the web data entry app, various quality checks can be run while entering data. These were shown in the data entry web app session.

Android Data Entry can be performed offline without an internet connection



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

As long as you are logged in to the Android app (and do not log out) and you can continue to enter data directly on the Android device without an internet connection.

Alternative methods of bringing data into DHIS2, such as importing the data or using PDF files, are possible



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Other methods of bringing data into DHIS2 are possible. This allows for transferring data from legacy systems or creating a data warehouse with data that is in different formats.

### Assignment - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets


#### NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4.

This series of assignments consist of 3 sets:



*   Set 1: Organisation Units
*   Set 2: Data Elements
*   Set 3: Data Sets

This series will allow you to build bits by bits a data set and populate it.

At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2) you will be ask to check whether you have completed the whole series or not. This check will allow the course team members to validate the result of your assignments in DHIS2 Customization. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignment will be confirmed. As for the other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts.

Note: Before the validation from the course team, the max grade for this series will be applied, but this grade is not the validated one.


##### Assignments Module 4 - Set 3/3 - Data Sets

Instructions

You need to be logged in [DHIS2 Customization](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action) to perform the following assignments.

Data Set Example

In the data element section you were provided with the following example data set.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Data Element
   </td>
   <td>Value
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of female sex workers reached with HIV prevention programs (Outreach)
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of PLHIV Attended
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Number of HIV positive TB patients who are already on ART or started on ART during TB treatment
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>TB07.10 Number of patients with positive bacteriological results out of diagnosis
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>TB07.19 Number of patients examined for follow-up
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>MAL02.01 Malaria Slide (Tested)
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



##### Assignment 4.6.1 - Create a default data set

Part 1

Using the data elements you have already created in the data element exercise, recreate this data set as a monthly data set collected at the facility level (assign the data set to the facilities you have created). Note that the Data set has already been created for you when you created your account. You can edit it and provide it with a better name if desired. You will need to edit the data sets properties, add the data elements that you have created to this data set and assign it to an organisation unit. This is to get around the issue of managing user privileges that was discussed in the video demonstration, as this data set is by default assigned to your user. 



<p id="gdcalert183" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image183.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert184">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image183.png "image_tooltip")


Part 2

Navigate to data entry app and select an organisation unit which you have assigned the data set to. Select a period and the data set you have created to confirm it has been created successfully.

![alt_text](images/image208.png "image_tooltip")


This will display the entities (people in this case) associated with the program. 



*   Try the various filters to see how the work. From left to right, the filters are the following:
    *   Only those with an event today: Filters entities who have an event scheduled today.
    *   Any enrolment status: Filters all entities within the program regardless of their status.
    *   Only those with active enrolment: Filters all entities that are currently receiving services within the selected program.
    *   Only those with completed enrolment: Filters those entities identified as having completed the set of services offered by the selected program.
    *   Only those with cancelled enrolment: Filters those entities identified as having cancelled their enrolment within the selected program (they did not receive the complete set of services and dropped out of the program).



<p id="gdcalert209" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image209.png).

![alt_text](images/image210.png "image_tooltip")




*   Show/hide columns: This will add additional columns to the tracker capture front page. These columns in tracker capture represent the attributes that are associated with the program you have selected. This differs from event capture where you saw the data elements here (event programs do not have attributes associated with them). You can access this using the "Show/hide columns" button.

##### Activity 1 - Introducing program indicators

In [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), create a pivot table including the program indicators:



*   # of facilities offering ANC
*   # of facilities offering family planning services

In the data tab select:



*   "Program Indicators" as the data type
*   "SARA RCH" as the Program
*   "# of facilities offering ANC" & "# of facilities offering family planning services" as the Program Indicators

### Session Quiz - Introduction to Tracker


#### NOTE: THIS IS A GRADED QUIZ.

You are allowed 3 attempts for this quiz.

There is 30 seconds of time between each attempt, so if you don't get it right, just breathe in, watch the videos once more and carefully read the question again.


##### Session Quiz - Introduction to Tracker

Tracker is meant to: (select one)



*   Replace existing electronic medical records (EMR)
*   Bridge the gap between the existing aggregated data and individual-level (tracker) or anonymous event based data
*   Only be used for tracking patients receiving health services

EXPLANATION

Tracker programs can be used outside of the health system, and are not meant to necessarily replace an EMR. This was discussed in the tracker intro presentation.

What is one of the key differences between event and tracker programs? (select one)



*   In tracker programs details are registered in order to follow an entity. Event programs do not include this registration
*   In event programs details are registered in order to follow an entity. Tracker programs do not include this registration
*   Event programs are more a more advanced version of collection individual data when compared to tracker programs

EXPLANATION

Tracker programs involve a key component of registration whereas event programs are anonymous in nature. This was discussed in the tracker intro presentation.

In event capture we can:



*   Add in validation rules/warnings
*   Add in indicators that calculate on-the-fly
*   Enter data offline

EXPLANATION

When we enter data in event/tracker capture, we must choose a predefined period such as weekly, monthly, etc. before entering data.



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

All of these functions work in event capture. This was demoed during the event capture session.

Which of the following statement(s) regarding tracker are NOT true: (select one or more)



*   Tracker and event data cannot be aggregated
*   Tracker and event data cannot be compared with aggregated data together
*   Tracker and event capture can be audited to see what changes have been made to the data

EXPLANATION

Tracker and event data can be aggregated and analyzed in the analysis apps. They can also be analyzed together with routine aggregate date. This was shown during the event analysis session.

An entity (person, etc.) can only be registered in one tracker program at a time



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

A person can be registered in multiple tracker programs if required.

In tracker capture, we can add in relationships, such as mother-child, brother-sister, etc.



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Relationships between various entities can be added using tracker capture.

In event capture, if someone comes back to the clinic with malaria more than once I can easily find their record again in DHIS2



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Event programs are isolated events. As there is no registration component, it would be very difficult to link these events as you would manually have to find the last time they received treatment.

We can analyze combined indicators that use any combination of data from event, tracker or routine aggregated data entry



*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

We can use combined indicators to combine any of the data types used within DHIS2. This was shown during the event analysis session.
