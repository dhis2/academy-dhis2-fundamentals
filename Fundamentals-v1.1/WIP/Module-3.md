## Module 3 - Introduction to DHIS2 Analysis (8 hr)


### 3.0 Overview of the module (10 min)


#### What is in this module?

In the previous module, you learned that DHIS2 is used in public health for the reporting, analysis, and dissemination of data. 

In this module, we’ll delve into the **analysis **function, understanding the **mechanics **of how** **to use the following DHIS2 applications: **Pivot table**, **Data visualizer**, **GIS** (now named Maps) and **Reports**.

By watching demonstrations, you’ll see how it’s possible to **combine **tables, charts and maps to create **integrated analysis**, how to create and share **dashboards**, how to **interact **with other DHIS2 members through the platform, and what are the main DHIS2 roles within a system.

After the demonstration videos, you will be prompted to replicate some of the steps on your own in Trainingland. This will help you become familiarized with the different apps and the navigation options of each one of them.

At the end of each subsection, you will find the **graded activities** of the module: in subsections **3.2, 3.3**, and **3.4**, you will find **assignments **and **quizzes**, while in subsections **3.5** and** 3.6** you will find only** quizzes**. All graded activities of this module together are worth **49%**  of your final grade.

We estimate that you will take about 8 -10 hours to view all the videos and complete all the learning activities, including the graded ones.


### 3.1 Data Analysis Overview Intro  (1,5 min)

### 3.2 Pivot Tables (140 min)


#### Video - Pivot Table Demo - Part 1 of 7 (17 min)

Let's start these sessions identifying how the **DHIS2 building blocks** that you have learned about in module 2 (**data**, **periods**, and **organisation units**) are selected to create a **pivot table**.

You'll start to familiarize yourself with the table **layout** and **options, **which are variables that will directly affect the outputs you create.

*Brief Note: In this table, there should not be more Malaria RDT positives then Malaria RDT performed. If this is occurring, then there is likely some issue with the quality of the data. For example, in Afghan Dispensary for the period Oct - Dec 2015 in both the &lt; 5 and >= 5 age group, we can see that there are more Malaria RDT positives then Malaria RDT performed. Malaria RDT positives are a direct result of performing an RDT test to detect malaria, and therefore the number of Malaria RDT performed should always be >= the number of Malaria RDT positives. 

Question of the assignment 3.2.4 

In Blueberry dispensary, were the total number of Malaria RDT positives greater than or less than the total number of Malaria RDTs performed?

EXPLANATION

The correct answer is greater than

In Chocolate Dispensary, how many Malaria RDTs were positive in Oct - Dec 2016 for the 'under 5 years' age group? (enter the value in the box below)

EXPLANATION

14 Malaria RDTs were positive in Oct - Dec 2016 for the 'under 5 years' age group within Chocolate Dispensary

#### Video - GIS Demo Part 3 of 8 (8 min)

In this video, we will review how to add thematic layers to our map. Thematic layers are one of the most useful tools when reviewing maps as they allow us to display different data directly on the map. Pay attention to the differences between this interface and the one you used on pivot tables and data visualizer tools when selecting data, periods, and organisation units.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSYbaqeo-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSYbaqeo-s)


##### Activity 3 - Adding a thematic layer 

Please create a map showing the number of Malaria RDT positives by facility within all of [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action).



*   Start by selecting Thematic layer 1 -> Edit layer.



<p id="gdcalert71" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image71.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert72">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image71.png "image_tooltip")




*   Define the data and period selection for Thematic Layer 1.

Note that the data and periods are defined in the same tab in the GIS app. This differs from the Pivot Table and Data Visualizer apps, where these were selected in separate tabs.



*   Select the following:
    *   Value type: Data Element
    *   Data element group: Malaria
    *   Data element: Malaria RDT positive
    *   Period Type: Yearly
    *   Period: 2016

![alt_text](images/image74.png "image_tooltip")



#### Video - GIS Demo Part 4 of 8 (9 min)

In this video, you will learn how to review and interpret the map, including how to review what the thematic legend is representing. In addition, options that allow you to alter how the map looks will be discussed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41ZI1D-feVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41ZI1D-feVM)


##### Activity 4 - Explanation and modification of the map options

In the map you have created in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), modify the number of classes and methods to see what effect this has on the legend. 



*   In the options tab:
    *   Modify the number of classes to 7
    *   Modify the method to "Equal counts"



<p id="gdcalert75" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image75.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert76">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

#### Video - GIS Demo Part 6 of 8 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to add multiple thematic layers to your map. Multiple thematic layers allow you to make comparisons of different data within the same map. This is particularly useful when you are trying to make correlations between various services you are measuring. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd7f8kM-jJo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd7f8kM-jJo)


##### Activity 6 - Adding multiple thematic layers

To the map you have created in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), please add in a 2nd thematic layer and save the map as a favorite.



*   Start by selecting Thematic layer 2 -> Edit layer.



<p id="gdcalert81" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image81.png).

![alt_text](images/image81.png "image_tooltip")




*   Define the data and period selection for Thematic layer 2. Select the following:
    *   Value type: Data Element
    *   Data element group: Malaria
    *   Data element: Malaria RDT performed
    *   Period Type: Yearly
    *   Period: 2016



<p id="gdcalert82" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image82.png).

### 3.5 - Integrated Analysis, Dashboards, Messaging and Sharing (60 min)


#### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 1 of 5 (7 min)

Now that we have reviewed each of the core analysis apps individually, we can discuss how they can work together in order to produce the most appropriate visual output to display your data. 

In this series of videos, you will learn how to quickly move between each of the analysis tools by taking any of your produced outputs and modifying them into a chart, map or pivot table on demand. You will also review how to create a dashboard where you can put together the different visualizations you have created from  pivot tables, data visualizer and GIS (Maps). Lastly, you will also learn how to share your dashboard with other DHIS2 users.

#### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 3 of 5 (10 min)

It’s time to learn how to **create a dashboard**. 

In this video, you will find all the steps you need to bring together the different outputs you have created before (and saved as favorites) using the data analysis tools (pivot tables, data visualizer, GIS) into one dashboard. You will also see how to share your dashboard with other users or groups of users.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TsUN4JRfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TsUN4JRfE)


##### Activity 3 - Dashboards 

Create a dashboard in [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action). In order to add items to a dashboard, you will first have to create a dashboard.



*   Do this by clicking on the "Add" button.



<p id="gdcalert111" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image111.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert112">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image111.png "image_tooltip")


A pop-up will appear in which you can provide the dashboard with a name.



*   Click on "Create" when you have finished creating the dashboard.



<p id="gdcalert112" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image112.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert113">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image112.png "image_tooltip")


To add items to the dashboard, use the search box located at the top. To add an item click on the "Add" button next to the favorite. If you click on the favorite name, it will take you directly to the favorite within the app it was created rather than adding it to the dashboard.



<p id="gdcalert113" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image113.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert114">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image113.png "image_tooltip")




*   Add the following items to the dashboard (these are all taken from your previous exercises on data analysis):
    *   ANC 1st and 4th (by ANC1) Coverage, Trainingland, Jan 2015 - Dec 2016 (Chart).
    *   Outpatient Attendance per 1,000 population, Trainingland, 2016 (Chart).
    *   Delivery in Facility, Trainingland Districts, Last 4 Quarters (Pivot Table).
    *   Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery, Delivery in Facility and Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery (%), Trainingland Districts, July - December 2016 (Pivot Table).

![alt_text](images/image117.png "image_tooltip")


You can move the items around and resize them to your liking in order to get a feel for how the objects on the dashboard work. This is a very useful tool for bringing together multiple analysis in a particular thematic area together in order to be reviewed quickly. It is particularly useful for program managers to receive at-a-glance information regarding the programs they are responsible for.

1. I have created a pivot table with the following dimensions:

- Data Element Group: Delivery

- Data Element: Births, Live

- Period: Last 4 Quarters

- Organisation Units: Trainingland Districts

In a real-life setting, a username will likely not be used to identify a favorite.

Which of the following is a good name for the favorite? (select one)



*   Live Births
*   Deliveries in Trainingland, last 4 Quarters
*   Live Births by Trainingland Districts, last 4 Quarters
*   Delivery_Live Births, Districts, last 4 Quarters

EXPLANATION

The naming convention for favorites should include the program name and the 3 core dimensions (what you are measuring, where it is coming from and when it is coming from). This option includes all of these aspects.



2. I want to do some analysis comparing all of the following:

- All Facilities within my organisation unit hierarchy

- The last 12 months worth of data

- A combination of two data elements and one indicator

Which tool(s) should I use to display this information? (select one or more)



*   This type of analysis is not possible in DHIS2
*   Data Visualizer
*   Pivot Table

The pivot table application is most suitable when you want to analyze multiple dimensions of data, including multiple organisation units, time periods and data types.



3. In DHIS2, I can add additional dimensions (such as Male/Female, Public/Private Facilities, etc.) to further break-down my data during analysis.
*   True
*   False

EXPLANATION

Data can be broken down into different disaggregations in analysis. This is shown in both the pivot table and data visualizer demonstrations.



4. If today's date is April 2, 2017 and I select a relative period of the last 5 years, which periods will be selected? (select one)
*   2011-2016
*   2012-2016
*   2013-2017

EXPLANATION

Relative periods work backwards from the current date. In 2017, if we go back 5 years we have 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.



5. Using the features in DHIS2 I can: (select one or more)
*   Move analysis seamlessly between pivot tables, charts and maps
*   Add descriptions to favorites to give them more context
*   Discuss interpretations of the favorites in the system with other users

EXPLANATION

The DHIS2 analysis tools allow you to move between the different applications, save outputs and add in descriptions and discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2.



6. Favorites can be shared: (select one or more)
*   Using specific privileges for each item (such as edit/view)
*   With other users within DHIS2
*   Directly from DHIS2 to social media

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as well as sharing sessions. This allows us to specify exactly who sees the outputs we have created.



7. With the DHIS2 dashboards you can: (select one)
*   Have multiple dashboards
*   Add favorites from analysis app
*   Share dashboards with groups of users
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Dashboards contain all the functionality discussed in this question. This was demonstrated during the dashboard demo.



8. What is the primary role(s) of dashboards? (select one)
*   Make data easily accessible
*   Make data easily communicable
*   Aid in decision making
*   Easily view data from multiple angles in one place
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Dashboards are useful in conveying a variety of different information together. This was demonstrated during the dashboard demo.



9. Sharing in DHIS2: (select one)
*   Is used to define which favorites can be seen by whom
*   Can be used to share dashboards with other users
*   Can be used to share interpretations with other users
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing can be used to customize the different outputs that can be seen by each user. This was best demonstrated during the sharing session.



10. Sharing is typically controlled by: (select one)
*   Selecting specific users in which to share objects
*   Selecting user groups in which to share objects
*   Sending items through messaging within DHIS2
*   All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as well as sharing sessions. This concept uses user groups to define who can see which outputs and related information in the system.



11. Messages can be sent within DHIS2 to: (select one or more)
*   Individual users
*   User Groups
*   Users belonging to an organisation unit

EXPLANATION

The messaging feature was presented in the integrated analysis session. Here, any combination of the displayed answers can be selected in order to send messages.

<p id="gdcalert122" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image122.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert123">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image122.png "image_tooltip")




*   Select the criteria for the data set report and click on "Get report" when ready. You can use the following as a guide:
    *   Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
    *   Period Type: Yearly
    *   Period: 2016
    *   Organisation Unit: Animal Region (you can try any org unit you like here)



<p id="gdcalert123" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image123.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert124">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image123.png "image_tooltip")




*   You will see the results for the dataset/period/organisation unit combination after you click on "Get report".

As discussed in the video, this gives you a layout of the data set as you would see it in data entry. You can not edit the data here however, and this can often serve as an ideal location to review the data in a format that users are familiar with. The data can be aggregated within this report, and therefore looked at within different levels of the hierarchy as required.



<p id="gdcalert124" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image124.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert125">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image124.png "image_tooltip")




*   Access the resources by using the left-side sub-menu.

![alt_text](images/image128.png "image_tooltip")


In order to run the report:



*   Define the criteria that you want to review first. In this example we can use the following:
    *   Report organisation unit: Food Region
    *   Group Set: Type
*   Select "Get report", in order to run the organisation unit report.



<p id="gdcalert129" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image129.png).

*   Select the criteria to run the report. In this example we can use
    *   Organisation Unit: Food Region
    *   Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
    *   Period Type: Quarterly
    *   Period: October- December 2016
*   Leave "Based on complete data set registrations" selected. This means that the completeness is calculated based on the user submitting a completed data set within the data entry app. This will be discussed more in later sessions.



<p id="gdcalert133" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image133.png).

#### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 3 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to view reporting rates directly in the pivot tables app. Reporting Rates are readily available within the reports app, but you can also use the pivot tables app to review reporting rates in DHIS2. This gives us the advantage of being able to review multiple levels of organisation unit reporting rates in one place. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q)


##### Activity 3 - Reporting Rates in Pivot Tables

In [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), view the reporting rates within the pivot tables application. We will select all of the metrics associated with the "Primary Health Care Monthly Data Set".



*   In the data tab select:
    *   "Data Sets" as the data type
    *   Select the various metrics followed by "Primary Health Care Monthly" as related to that metric. For example, select the "Reporting Rates" metric type followed by the "Primary Health Care Monthly (Reporting rates)" metric. Repeat this for all metric types
*   Arrange the metrics you’ve selected according to the order you want them displayed within the pivot table.



<p id="gdcalert135" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image135.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert136">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image135.png "image_tooltip")




*   In the period tab select "Last year" as the period. The last year that is displayed will be different than what is shown in the video.



<p id="gdcalert136" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image136.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert137">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image136.png "image_tooltip")




*   In the organisation units tab select "Food Region" as the organisation unit and "Facility" as the organisation unit level.



<p id="gdcalert137" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image137.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert138">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image137.png "image_tooltip")




*   Alter the table layout so that the organisation units are displayed (ensure the organisation unit is not in the filter).



<p id="gdcalert138" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image138.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert139">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image138.png "image_tooltip")


You can also open the table options and deselect "Show row totals" in order to remove a nonsensical total in this case.



<p id="gdcalert139" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image139.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert140">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image139.png "image_tooltip")




*   Click on "Update" in order to see the output. Not you will see a much longer list of facilities within DHIS2. This image is only showing the top portion of the actual output.



<p id="gdcalert140" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image140.png).

### Session Quiz - Reports App and Reporting Rates (10 min)


#### Session Quiz - Reports App and Reporting Rates

This is a **graded quiz** and it is worth **5%** of your final grade.

You have **3 attempts** for this quiz.

Select the "**check**" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for grading yet, select the "save" button. This allows you to come back later and resume the attempt.



1. What does the data set report allow you to do? (select one)
*   Review data as it would appear in data entry and allow you to update/edit the data
*   Review data as it would appear in data entry without allowing you to modify it
*   Output the data as a user-defined one-click report

EXPLANATION

Data set reports were highlighted during the reports app demo. It is always a good idea to review data in the data set report rather than data entry as you cannot modify data in this report.



2. Resources in DHIS2 can be used to: (select one or more)
*   Upload items such as data collection forms, guidelines or annual reports
*   Add links to useful websites
*   Add additional assets that will increase DHIS2's performance

EXPLANATION

Resources were demonstrated in the reports app demo. Resources can be useful for uploading external documentation and links to external resources amongst other things. In this case, resources do not correspond with additional resources to power the DHIS2 system.



3. Organisation unit distribution reports can be used to: (select one or more)
*   Provide a total count of organisation units that appear at certain levels within the hierarchy
*   Display organisation units based on the groups they belong to
*   Show the geographic distribution of organisation units on a map

EXPLANATION

The organisation unit distribution report was demonstrated in the reports app demo. This allows us to separate our organisation units into user defined categories/groups as well as see the number of organisation units at different levels of the hierarchy.



4. In DHIS2, the reporting rate completeness can be checked in: (select one or more)
*   The reports app by running the reporting rate summary
*   Pivot Table, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in
*   Data Visualizer, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in

EXPLANATION

Reporting rates can be accessed in various parts of DHIS2. This includes in the reports app as well as the different analysis apps.
