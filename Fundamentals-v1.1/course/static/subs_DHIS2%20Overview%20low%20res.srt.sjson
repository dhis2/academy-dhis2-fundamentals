    "different dashboards that are available", 
    "The dashboard that each user sees is", 
    "completely customizable.", 
    "We can also share these dashboards with other users.", 
    "We will get into both of these topics later on.", 
    "In dhis to there are some features", 
    "that allow us to customize our experience a little bit.", 
    "If I go over the initials in the corner here", 
    "initials in the corner here", 
    "and click on settings", 
    "we can actually offer some of", 
    "the settings for the application", 
    "This is per user", 
    "This includes examples like the", 
    "interface language, the database language", 
    "and the style of the application", 
    "Let&#39;s change the style to see what effect this has", 
    "We also have a tab for user profile", 
    "This allows us to update our own details", 
    "It&#39;s always a good idea to", 
    "fill in the profile later on", 
    "as this facilitates communication and follow up", 
    "And then the last part is the account settings", 
    "where we can of course update or change our password", 
    "If I go back to the dashboard", 
    "we can see how the style affects the application", 
    "In DHIS2 one of the key", 
    "principles is that all the items that", 
    "are made for either data collection or", 
    "data output should be definable", 
    "through the user interface", 
    "In DHIS2 we use the maintenance application", 
    "to update the various items that we are collecting", 
    "for the outputs that we are creating", 
    "we will discuss quite a few of these", 
    "objects that are available in a lot more detail", 
    "in other sessions", 
    "In DHIS2 there are multiple ways to collect data", 
    "There are three broad categories of data DHIS2 can collect", 
    "This includes numerical or aggregated data", 
    "anonymous individualized data", 
    "as well as individual data that has some kind of", 
    "identifiers attached to the data", 
    "Let&#39;s show you an example of the", 
    "numerical based data entry", 
    "In the numerical base data entry we enter data", 
    "by the structure of the system we are working with", 
    "This could be a health system or an organization", 
    "depending on how DHIS2 is being used", 
    "In this example we have a", 
    "health system hierarchy built-in to DHIS2", 
    "This allows us to select for example", 
    "a facility to enter data into", 
    "There are a number of different reporting forms", 
    "that can be made in DHIS2", 
    "These can be simple reporting forms that are", 
    "generated by the system itself", 
    "But we can also create more complex forms that", 
    "more closely reflect paper-based forms", 
    "that are being used in the field", 
    "We will discuss the creation of these datasets", 
    "in a bit of detail, later on.", 
    "The next type of data that can be entered into DHIS2", 
    "is anonymous individual data", 
    "This can be for example, something like", 
    "a facility survey or some type of line list", 
    "that doesn&#39;t have any identifying information", 
    "attached to it", 
    "in this example we have a survey that&#39;s", 
    "being entered by facility", 
    "We can then enter the data for each individual facility", 
    "and then receive the results through DHIS2", 
    "We can create different statistics and outputs", 
    "based on the data that is entered", 
    "We will discuss method of collecting data", 
    "a little bit more later on.", 
    "The last time of data entry", 
    "is individual information that does have", 
    "identifying characteristics", 
    "This means that we can identify the person", 
    "by their name..", 
    "by some type of unique identifier..", 
    "their phone number..", 
    "or any other identifying characteristics", 
    "attached to that particular person", 
    "Note that this type of data entry can be", 
    "extended beyond people", 
    "and beyond the health sector", 
    "but in this example we are tracking a person", 
    "In DHIS2 you can actually register the person", 
    "in a certain program or just in DHIS2 itself", 
    "and register them in multiple types of services", 
    "and then you can collect information", 
    "related to the services that they are receiving", 
    "In this example we register a child", 
    "to receive their set of immunizations", 
    "You can see that there are", 
    "multiple identifiers available for this person", 
    "including the first and last name", 
    "the child number", 
    "and their mothers first and last name", 
    "These can all be used to help", 
    "in identifying the child", 
    "They will then be tracked through", 
    "their set of immunization services .", 
    "Later on we will go through an example", 
    "where we register a person and", 
    "track them through the", 
    "various services that they receive.", 
    "Once we&#39;ve entered all our data into DHIS2", 
    "there are a couple different methods", 
    "which we can use to check on the quality", 
    "of the data.", 
    "One of these methods is to", 
    "check on mathematical rules that we", 
    "build into DHIS2.", 
    "This ensures that the data", 
    "meets certain criteria when it&#39;s", 
    "entered into the system", 
    "We can run this type of analysis", 
    "all at once.", 
    "We can see that when we run this type of", 
    "analysis it brings up any issues with", 
    "the data quality based on these rules", 
    "that we&#39;ve created", 
    "We will discuss this", 
    "in a bit more detail in later sessions", 
    "In DHIS2 we can also create", 
    "standard type reports that are based off", 
    "different organizational or ministry templates", 
    "One of these tools is called a standard report", 
    "using these types of standard reports", 
    "you can make your own customized outputs", 
    "within DHIS2", 
    "Although we won&#39;t discuss how to create these during", 
    "the fundamental level course", 
    "it&#39;s important to note that these types of", 
    "reports are possible", 
    "We can also run data approval", 
    "This is the process of approving data", 
    "within DHIS2", 
    "We can use data approval", 
    "to approve data at any level within the", 
    "organization that you&#39;re working with", 
    "This allows us to review the data", 
    "electronically and then electronically", 
    "approve this data as well", 
    "Once we run some checks on our data to ensure that", 
    "its quality we can go ahead and create", 
    "some outputs in DHIS2", 
    "There are several tools available", 
    "in order to create these outputs", 
    "The ones we will be focusing on are the pivot table", 
    "data visualizer and GIS", 
    "These allow us to make tables charts and maps", 
    "respectively", 
    "These types of outputs can", 
    "be generated very quickly by DHIS2", 
    "as long as we have data entered into the", 
    "system", 
    "Here&#39;s an example of a pivot table", 
    "We can see how quickly it appears", 
    "This is of course an example of a previous table", 
    "that&#39;s already been created but we will", 
    "go over the ins and outs of creating", 
    "these tables within DHIS2", 
    "DHIS2 also supports the creation of different chart types", 
    "Once again all these charts are", 
    "based on the data that&#39;s entered into DHIS2", 
    "Lastly, we have maps", 
    "There are quite a few different features", 
    "available in the GIS application within DHIS2", 
    "We will discuss them in more detail later on", 
    "but you can see here that we", 
    "can create different outputs based on", 
    "the data thats entered, just like for", 
    "charts and tables", 
    "One of the interesting features in DHIS2", 
    "that allows you to extend the usability", 
    "of these different analysis items", 
    "is that we can add descriptions and", 
    "interpretations", 
    "This allows you to provide a bit more", 
    "context to the data that you&#39;re displaying", 
    "You can also share these", 
    "analyses with other users in order to", 
    "share what you found and start a", 
    "discussion", 
    "DHIS2 also has some in-build tools", 
    "in order to facilitate more", 
    "private discussion", 
    "In DHIS2 you can write messages and write feedback", 
    "DHIS2 has an internal messaging", 
    "application that allows you to message", 
    "other users in the system", 
    "There is also a feedback system", 
    "A feedback system within DHIS2", 
    "allows those users who are", 
    "managing the system to prioritize this", 
    "feedback and respond to it as necessary", 
    "They can also have internal discussions", 
    "about the problems and try to solve them", 
    "before returning the response back to", 
    "the user", 
    "We will discuss this feature in more detail", 
    "later on", 
    "Now everything that&#39;s created in DHIS2", 
    "can actually be shared with other users", 
    "so we can decide actually who share our", 
    "different analyses with", 
    "We will discuss how to do this", 
    "a little bit more later on", 
    "That has been a very quick overview of DHIS2", 
    "We will start going over", 
    "these features in a little bit more", 
    "detail in the following sections"
