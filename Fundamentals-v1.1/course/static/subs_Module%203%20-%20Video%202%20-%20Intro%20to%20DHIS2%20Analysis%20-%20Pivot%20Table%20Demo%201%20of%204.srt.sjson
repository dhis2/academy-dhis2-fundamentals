    "This session will be an overview of the pivot table app   ", 
    "in this session we will introduce the pivot table interface", 
    "We will start by going over a detailed introduction of selecting our data dimensions that contribute to our final table outputs", 
    "this includes selecting data, periods and organization units in particular", 
    "we will go through a couple of examples showing you the creation of some different types of pivot tables", 
    "we will also discuss how the table layout affects the pivot table output", 
    "you also described the very skinny table options that are available", 
    "in shelling by the CIA table favorites and provide cable descriptions", 
    "you also show how dumb tables to our computer", 
    "U.N. session by reviewing all various concepts that we&#39;ve gone over", 
    "lets go ahead and get started with the session", 
    "in this session we will go over the pivot tables", 
    "The pivot tables allow us to make dynamic tables and output them directly within DHIS2", 
    "We showed you some examples initially when we did the DHIS2 overview session ", 
    "In order to access the pivot table application", 
    "I&#39;ll click where it says search apps", 
    "and then I&#39;ll click on the pivot table application", 
    "this is going to load the pivot table application for me to review", 
    "we can see on the left hand side we have a variety of different inputs ", 
    "this includes the core building blocks which we discussed earlier", 
    "Our data", 
    "Our periods and our organization units", 
    "at the top we have some additional configuration options", 
    "we can update add a favorite adjust the layout and change the options as well as options to download and embed", 
    "lets discuss some of these features through this demo ", 
    "there are actually multiple data types", 
    "this includes indicators which as we identified earlier are different from data elements", 
    "indicators are our calculated values ", 
    "we have data elements which are the actual raw counts that we enter through our numerical based data entry", 
    "We have datasets that allow us to define characteristics associated with an entire dataset", 
    "this includes items such as the reporting rate ", 
    "event data items and program indicators are used in event and tracker based programs", 
    "we will discuss those two options later", 
    "for now will focus on the first three indicators data elements and datasets", 
    "in our first example lets select a data element to review", 
    "we&#39;ll select the data elements as our data type", 
    "and then we can see that the next prompt asks us to select a data element group", 
    "in DHIS2 we group our data elements together ", 
    "this allows us to quickly find data elements that are within the same thematic group or within the same health program ", 
    "this all depends how we define these groups and we will show you how to create these groups later on", 
    "when I click on the prompt to select the data element group a number of different groups appear", 
    "lets work with one example looking at maternal deaths within Trainingland", 
    "the maternal deaths data element belongs to the delivery data element group", 
    "I&#39;m going to select the delivery group", 
    "and the data elements associated with that group will appear", 
    "we can see here but I have the maternal deaths right here", 
    "we&#39;ll get into why these are named a certain way in other sessions but we can see that the", 
    "different deaths are listed in alphabetical order for review", 
    "in order to select this maternal death data element I can highlight the data element", 
    "and use the single arrow ", 
    "we can see that moves it from available to selected", 
    "I can use the same process to move it back from selected to available", 
    "I can also double click on the data element and this will move it from available to selected", 
    "the double arrows take all of the data elements within the group and move it from available", 
    "to selected", 
    "If I only want to select a subset", 
    "of data elements", 
    "on a PC I hold down control and select the data elements I want to review ", 
    "on Mac I will hold down command", 
    "then I can use the single to move those data elements from available to selected", 
    "since we just want to focus on one data element lets select the maternal deaths data element", 
    "we&#39;ve now selected the data element this is the what aspect of our analysis; it is one of the three key dimensions that we discussed earlier", 
    "the next data dimension that we want to select is the period", 
    "this is the time dimension of this analysis", 
    "this will define what period of time our analysis will show", 
    "if I click on periods", 
    "We can see that there are actually two types of periods available for me to select", 
    "at the bottom I have what I refer to ", 
    "as relative periods", 
    "Relative periods are relative from today&#39;s date", 
    "this means that if I have the last five years highlighted and is currently 2016", 
    "It will select the years from 2011 to 2015", 
    "notice that this current year is not selected", 
    "there is however relative period that indicates we could select this year and we could use that select 2017", 
    "this is an important concept", 
    "as the relative periods allow for a lot of flexibility in our analysis we&#39;ll get into this a bit more as we go through this session", 
    "we can also select a defined period", 
    "Here at the top we have a prompt to select the period type", 
    "if we choose the drop down we see the different period types that are available", 
    "if I select yearly for example a number of years will appear", 
    "I can then specify the years that I want to show in my analysis", 
    "for example if I only wanted to choose 2011, 12 and 13", 
    "I can just double click on those years to move them from available to selected ", 
    "when you&#39;re using these defined periods make sure to de-select any relative period that might have been chosen earlier otherwise you will get a ", 
    "mix of both the predefined period you selected as well as the relative period.", 
    "In this example let&#39;s use a relative period", 
    "One of the advantages of using of relative periods", 
    "Is that you don&#39;t have to continuously update any of the tables that you have already made", 
    "this is because the last four quarters that I&#39;ve selected in this particular example will continuously update as future periods arise ", 
    "this means that I can save the table and as time goes forward the last four quarters as represented on the table will automatically update", 
    "because these relative periods possess a lot of inherent advantages we will use them frequently in the analysis sessions", 
    "so I&#39;ve selected my data which is the what aspect of my analysis", 
    "I selected the periods which is my when aspect", 
    "and now I&#39;m going to select the organization units this is the where aspect of my analysis", 
    "for now I&#39;m just going to select Trainingland", 
    "we can see its automatically highlighted", 
    "there are actually a number of different ways to select a different organization unit within DHIS2 however", 
    "if I did want to select a different organization unit then I could go through this process ", 
    "and access the other organizations that are available", 
    "just like in data entry I can hit the plus signs beside my regions to expand my organization unit hierarchy tree", 
    "I can also click on the plus signs beside the district&#39;s see all the facilities", 
    "we can select any combination of organization units to appear in our analysis", 
    "for this first example with Trainingland highlighted", 
    "it will output the data for the entire country", 
    "lets just go ahead and create a simple table and continue from there", 
    "in order to output the data I click on the update button", 
    "now we can quickly see that this pivot table has been created", 
    "you can see that the last four quarters from the current date are displayed", 
    "the organization, which is Traininglang is highlighted at the top", 
    "and the data element that I selected which is the maternal deaths also appears in the pivot table", 
    "in this table we have a duplicated total", 
    "this might not be so useful", 
    "we can see that the column total is quite nice to have as it shows the total over that period", 
    "But the row total is just repeated ", 
    "lets remove this from the table", 
    "in order to remove this I click on options", 
    "you can see that a number of different table options appear when I click on the options button", 
    "we&#39;ll discuss these in a little more detail later on", 
    "for now I just want remove the row totals", 
    "we can see that underneath this data tab we have options to remove column and row totals", 
    "lets remove the row totals from this table", 
    "once I&#39;ve de-selected that option", 
    "I&#39;m going to go ahead and click on update", 
    "this removes that duplicated total from my pivot table", 
    "this current table displays the data by quarter for the entire country", 
    "but what if I want to review this data by district", 
    "I can do that as well by selecting all the districts with Trainingland and adding them to this table", 
    "earlier I mentioned that there are different ways to select organization units within DHIS2", 
    "lets go through a couple different methods now to select the district&#39;s", 
    "If I expand the tree", 
    "I can see all the districts available within Trainingland", 
    "I can select all of these individual districts by holding down control on my PC or command on my Mac", 
    "and simply clicking on all of these districts", 
    "that might not be the most intuitive method especially if you have an organization unit ", 
    "structure where there is a lot of organization units to choose from", 
    "we can change the method in which we select our organization units by clicking on this gear icon in the organization unit pane", 
    "lets change to select levels", 
    "we discussed the concept of organization unit levels", 
    "in our introductory discussion", 
    "in Trainingland there are four levels", 
    "one of them is district", 
    "if I want to select all the districts within Trainingland", 
    "I can click on select organization unit levels", 
    "and select the district level", 
    "with Trainingland highlighted it will select all of the districts within the country", 
    "if I only have food region highlighted then it will only select the district&#39;s that belong to food region", 
    "in this example I want to select all of the districts within the country", 
    "so I&#39;m going to select Trainingland", 
    "if I update this table", 
    "we can see actually nothing really changes", 
    "the organization units appear at the top but that is not ideal", 
    "I want these organization units to appear in my table so I can see the number of maternal deaths", 
    "for each district", 
    "in order to have these organization units appear on the pivot table we have to modify the layout", 
    "lets click on the layout button and get a better idea of what the table layout looks like", 
    "for anyone whose used Microsoft excel some of these terms should be familiar", 
    "we have the filter, a column and a row", 
    "this determines where our data is displayed", 
    "right now the organization units are acting as our filter", 
    "because of this they are not displayed in the table itself", 
    "they are only displayed at the top indicated that those districts have been selected", 
    "we can move this organization unit down in order for it to appear on our table", 
    "lets add the organization units as a row", 
    "we can drag and drop the item", 
    "by selecting organization units", 
    "and dragging it down to the row", 
    "you can see that there&#39;s a green line with arrows on each side to indicate that this is being done successfully", 
    "once I let go of my mouse the organization unit dimension will appear in the row", 
    "lets also move the period over so we can also to clear the table a little bit more", 
    "I&#39;m going to perform the same task as I did before by dragging period from the row", 
    "to the column. see the green line still appears", 
    "now I&#39;m going to go ahead and update my table", 
    "we can see that when I update the table we now have the number of maternal deaths separated by district", 
    "we can see that in this example there are only maternal deaths", 
    "in bird district, dog district and fish district", 
    "We might not want to display the organization units that don&#39;t have any deaths", 
    "we can remove these from the options selection in the pivot table", 
    "lets click on the options again", 
    "here we have an option to hide the empty rows there are a number of empty rows in this table", 
    "that is a result of these organization units not having any maternal deaths within the period that we have specified", 
    "if I select hide empty rows", 
    "and then click on update", 
    "you can see it will hide those districts in which there are no maternal deaths", 
    "from this table we can note that all the maternal deaths", 
    "occur within animal region", 
    "bird district, dog district and fish district all belong to animal region", 
    "its therefore no longer necessary to include food region in our analyses anymore", 
    "for example if I want to understand", 
    "which facilities these deaths are coming from", 
    "the I can analyze the facilities either within these three districts or within animal region and hide my empty rows", 
    "lets select the facilities within bird district dog district and fish district in order to determine exactly where these maternal deaths", 
    "are coming from", 
    "in order to select these districts I&#39;m going to hold down control on my PC or command on my Mac and select bird, dog and fish district", 
    "I&#39;m going to de-select Trainingland", 
    "right now I&#39;m on the organization unit level selection method", 
    "we can still use this to select the facilities within these districts", 
    "let us first de-select district", 
    "and that we can select facility", 
    "this is going to select all of the facilities within these three districts", 
    "with these 3 districts selects, lets go ahead and update our table", 
    "you can see the facilities now appear in the table", 
    "only a couple facilities appear because remember we have ticked the hide empty rows option", 
    "lets remove that so we can make sure that all the facilities were selected", 
    "go to options", 
    "de-select hide empty rows", 
    "and update the table", 
    "there are quite a few facilities that don&#39;t have any maternal deaths", 
    "lets remove these again from the table as the table before was a bit more clear", 
    "go back to options and select hide empty rows", 
    "and then update our table", 
    "now we can actually see where these maternal deaths are coming from", 
    "lets just quickly sort the data by one of the periods", 
    "we can do this by selecting the up and down arrows", 
    "next to each period", 
    "We can see that minnow district hospital has the most number of maternal deaths", 
    "for the October to December 2015 period", 
    "This is actually true for the other periods as well but we can sort based on any individual period", 
    "within the table by using these up and down arrows", 
    "now that we&#39;ve gone through the trouble of finding out where these maternal deaths come from we might want to continue to track this over time", 
    "lets go ahead and save this so we can refer to it later on", 
    "in order to save an item within the DHIS2 I click on favorites", 
    "and then I&#39;ll click on save as", 
    "I can give the favorite a name as well as a description", 
    "we&#39;re going to use a naming convention", 
    "as we go through the sessions", 
    "this will have our username the program name", 
    "and then it will have at minimum our three data dimensions what ", 
    "where and when referring to the data elements", 
    "the organization units and the time periods that we selected in our analysis", 
    "lets go ahead and fill this out according to those criteria", 
    "we are working with the delivery program", 
    "we have selected", 
    "the maternal deaths", 
    "these maternal deaths are occurring within a subset of facilities within animal region", 
    "but because I&#39;ve only selected the three districts bird, dog and fish I should specify that it&#39;s only referring to these three districts", 
    "we&#39;ve also used a relative period in our analysis", 
    "by giving it a generic name as time moves forward this will always be referring to the period that&#39;s attached to this particular table", 
    "by giving it a generic name as time moves forward this will always be referring to the period that&#39;s attached to this particular table", 
    "we can give this table a description so when others refer to it they have a better idea", 
    "of what they&#39;re looking at", 
    "once we have given the favorite a name and a description we can go ahead and save it", 
    "we can access the favorite by going to favorites", 
    "clicking on open", 
    "and then searching for our favorite", 
    "we can see that by entering my username I can find the favorive that I created", 
    "if I use these triple arrow&#39;s located on the left hand side", 
    "I can actually view my description", 
    "this allows us to give some more context to the individual analyses that were creating within DHIS2", 
    "lets go ahead and continue with another example", 
    "I&#39;m going to clear this by clicking on favorites then new", 
    "this will remove some of the selections from the previous table", 
    "in the previous example we worked with data elements", 
    "lets work with some indicators this time", 
    "we&#39;re going to change the data type to indicators", 
    "lets work with a couple indicators", 
    "from the immunization group", 
    "in particular we&#39;ll look at some immunization coverages", 
    "we can select the BCG coverage", 
    "and the DPT3 coverage", 
    "indicators are made up of typically a numerator, a denominator and a factor", 
    "these are calculated values compared to data elements", 
    "these are calculated values compared to data elements", 
    "which are the raw data values that we enter during aggregated data entry for example", 
    "if we look at the BCG coverage indicator this is made up of the number of the BCG doses given, this is our data element", 
    "divided by denominator of the population of less than one year, this is another data element", 
    "multiplied by a factor of 100%", 
    "this gives us the proportional indicator for BCG coverage", 
    "DPT3 is very similar, except we substitute the number of DPT3 doses given", 
    "for the BCG doses given", 
    "this is how indicators and data elements differ within DHIS2", 
    "and this is an important concept to ensure these two items are separated", 
    "we now selected our data so let&#39;s go ahead and select our periods", 
    "I&#39;ll click on periods", 
    "and we&#39;ll work with the last six months", 
    "I&#39;ll de-select last 5 years", 
    "and select the last six months", 
    "we selected our what our when", 
    "now lets select our where", 
    "in this case I want the coverage rates by district", 
    "I&#39;m going to change my selection method", 
    "to select levels", 
    "and then I&#39;m going to select the district", 
    "with Trainingland highlighted it will select all of the districts within Trainingland", 
    "now remember from the previous example", 
    "the organization units did not appear when I clicked on update I first had to adjust the layout of the pivot table", 
    "lets check again to make sure that the organization units are in the right location", 
    "we click on layout and we can see that the organization units are actually being filtered out", 
    "we don&#39;t want this to happen so lets move some of the organization units back down to the row", 
    "remember we just drag and drop the item", 
    "we can also move the period so this displays in the column rather then the row", 
    "once we&#39;ve defined our table layout we can go ahead and update the pivot table",

    "the font size",

    "80 to 90 is in light blue", 
    "and 90 to 100 is in green", 
    "anything above 100 is in grey this is because we have to check if this data is actually valid. In real life settings you often have ", 
    "immunization coverages that are greater than 100% So its a good idea to check on these to see what&#39;s going on", 
    "just like before we can save this table as a favorite", 
    "we go to favorites and click on save as", 
    "we provide it with a name just as before remember we use our username",

    "lets add that in and click on update", 
    "you can see now that the table is assigned the title that we&#39;ve given in the options tab", 
    "less go through an additional example looking at the disaggregated categories that are available for different data elements", 
    "so what if we have a data element that&#39;s separated into dis-aggregations", 
    "this could be for example a data element that collects information on male and female", 
    "or has certain age groups that are attached to it lets take a look at this concept in a bit more detail",

    "so let&#39;s go ahead and go through example which allows us to accomplish this", 
    "we&#39;re going to change back from details to totals",

    "just be careful when we do this", 
    "we have to make sure that we&#39;re adding disaggregations", 
    "that have data attached to the particular data elements we are working with",

    "for example this data element is already separated into 15 to 19 years", 
    "if I try to select an age group", 
    "if I try to select an age group", 
    "say less than 12 months and 12-59 months", 
    "it&#39;s not going to work", 
    "I&#39;ll select those age groups and click update you can now see that no data appears",

    "understanding of what regions and districts these facilities belong to", 
    "if we click on options", 
    "we can add in the hierarchy. This will show the district names and region names for each facility", 
    "now we can see after I update", 
    "the region and district name for each facility. They currently all belong to the same column so if I were to say download this as Excel again", 
    "you can see that the organization units actually appear just in one single column", 
    "this may not be ideal for a number of different reasons especially if we want to dissect the data a little bit more", 
    "lets go back to the DHIS2 pivot table application", 
    "after I have added the hierarchy and I click on download", 
    "we can see that there&#39;s an option to download this is as a plain data source with hierarchy",

    "if I&#39;m working with a data element then I&#39;m working with a raw piece of data this is", 
    "numerical data that&#39;s been entered during data entry typically", 
    "I next want to select my period", 
    "My period can be any period I want to select. It can be predefined using the available types up top and ", 
    "it can be relative using the period tapes available at the bottom", 
    "relative periods are particularly useful as they update overtime", 
    "next I select my organization unit we discussed two methods to select the organization units", 
    "one method was actually selecting the individual organisation units that we want to appear in our analysis", 
    "the other was changing the selection mode to select levels", 
    "and then selecting the level in the organization unit hierarchy that we want to appear in the pivot table", 
    "underneath these 3 core data dimensions we can add in additional dimensions", 
    "this allows us to separate disaggregated values", 
    "in our analysis", 
    "before we create a table we should generally check on the layout to make sure data is appearing in places that we want to", 
    "buy default the organization units are filtered so if we do want them to appear in the pivot ", 
    "table we should make sure to change our layout accordingly", 
    "when I&#39;m ready to display the table I can click on update", 
    "we can see in this case the organization units don&#39;t appear because I have not moved them", 
    "lets move them to the row", 
    "we can move our periods over as well", 
    "and then we can update our table", 
    "there are a number of extra items on this table that we might want to remove", 
    "for example we this duplicated total", 
    "in this case it&#39;s useful to have the row total but we might want to remove the subtotal", 
    "we can do this by clicking on options", 
    "and then adjusting the items that we want to remove", 
    "we can save our items as well by adding them to favorites. You click on favorites, click on save and provide the name and a description", 
    "we always want to follow the convention we we are using our username", 
    "our program name", 
    "and then what", 
    "where and when covering the data dimensions that are contributing to the output of our favorite", 
    "it&#39;s also good to put a description of the item", 
    "so people can see what you&#39;re referring to in  particular for that favorite that you created", 
    "it gives some more context and information about the item", 
    "in the options we can also add in the hierarchy", 
    "the hierarchy allows us to download this offline", 
    "with the hierarchy in tact. It&#39;s also just generally useful to see where those organization units are coming from", 
    "This ends the pivot table session", 
    "we&#39;ll move on to the data visualizer in the next session", 
    "but first give the exercises a try and let us know if you&#39;re having any trouble"
