<h2>NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4.</h2>
<p>This series of assignments consist of 3 sets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set 1: Organisation Units</strong></li>
<li>Set 2: Data Elements</li>
<li>Set 3: Data Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>This series will allow you to build bits by bits a data set and populate it.</p>
<p>At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2) you will be ask to check whether you have completed the whole series or not. This check will allow the course team members to validate&nbsp;the result of your assignments in DHIS2 Customization. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignment will be confirmed. As for the other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 1em;">Note: Before the validation from the course team, the max grade for this series will be applied, but this grade is not the validated one.</span></em></p>

<h2>Assignments Module 4 - Set&nbsp;1/3 - Organisation Units</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>You need to be logged in <a href="https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action" target="_blank">DHIS2 Customisation</a>&nbsp;to perform the following assignments.</p>
<p>You are tasked with creating a portion of the organization unit hierarchy within your country. The data should be entered at the correct level so appropriate outputs can be created. The hierarchy in this example country has 4 levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Country</li>
<li>Province</li>
<li>District</li>
<li>Facility</li>
</ol>
<p>You will notice that the Country level organisation unit has been created using your e-mail address when you enter organisation unit maintenance. This is so that you will only see the organisation units that you are creating, rather than seeing everyone&rsquo;s organisation units together. Feel free to change the name of this organisation unit to something else if you desire.</p>
