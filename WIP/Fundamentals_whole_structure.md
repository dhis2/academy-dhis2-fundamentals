## 1.1 About the course

### Welcome to DHIS2 Fundamentals

We are excited you have joined us for this course on DHIS2
Fundamentals!

Here in module 1, you’ll find an overview of the course, get
familiarized with the Open edX platform, and find the most important
information to get started.

#### What is this course about

Throughout this course, you will learn the essentials of DHIS2, an
open-source information system that facilitates decision making within a
wide variety of sectors thanks to its wide range of data capture,
review, analysis, and sharing capabilities. In this course, we will be
using public health for all of our examples, but note that DHIS2 is also
used in other sectors such as environment and education.

#### What will I learn

After completing this course, you’ll be able to:

- Describe how DHIS2 can be used to aggregate, analyze, review, and
    share data from health programs.
- Describe the key concepts, building blocks, and terminology of
    DHIS2.  
- Create pivot tables, charts, and maps to visualize data within
    DHIS2.
- Identify the initial steps to customize DHIS2 for aggregate data to
    meet the needs of a given country or organization.
- Differentiate the mechanisms used for data capture within DHIS2
    along with their main features

#### What are the course prerequisites

There are no specific prerequisites to do this course. However, having
basic knowledge or prior experience using data analysis tools (such as
Microsoft Excel) is an advantage.

#### How is the course structured

DHIS2 Fundamentals is comprised of 6 modules:

- Module 1: Overview and Getting Started (45 min)
- Module 2:  Introduction to DHIS2 (1 hr)
- Module 3:  Introductions to DHIS2 Analysis (8 hr)
- Module 4: Introduction to DHIS2 Customization (6 hr)
- Module 5: Introduction to Tracker (3 hr)
- Module 6: Summary Concepts (20 min)

#### How will I learn

In each module, you will find video presentations, demonstrations,
knowledge check questions, and step-by-step activities to be completed
in Trainingland and Customization (the training environments you will
use along the course). You’ll find more information about Trainingland
and Customization in the “Practical information” section.

Each topic is presented in the form of  videos of approximately 5 to 15
minutes in length. Watch them at your leisure (or download them to save
them for later) participate in the discussions, and see how much you’ve
learned by taking the assignments afterward.

After watching the videos, you’ll have the chance to practice what has
been demonstrated. By going through these activities, you will improve
your understanding of the fundamentals of DHIS2. These practice
activities are not graded; they are meant to give you a chance to
practice the concepts that have been shown through self-paced exercises.
 The more activities you do, the more you will get out of the course.

#### How long will it take to complete the course

We estimate the course will take approximately  20 hours to complete.
This includes the review of all videos, performing related activities
and completing all graded assignments. As this is a self-paced course,
note that this may vary slightly for each learner.

#### How do I pass the course

The course consists of 3 types of assessments that contribute to your
final grade:

- **Assignments**: are based on a step by step interactions you will need
    to perform within the training environment, followed by
    multiple-choice and /or multiple response questions. You will find
    these assignments in modules 3 and 5, and they contribute 16% to
    your final grade.
- **Customization Lab**: in module 4, you'll find 3 sets of activities
    where you'll be prompted to create the basic customization of a
    DHIS2 instance. These sets of assignments assess crucial knowledge
    and skills and they are graded as pass/fail, which means that if you
    don't successfully complete all the tasks, you will not get any
    partial credit. Customization Lab counts 24% of your final grade.
- **Quizzes**: you will find along the course different quizzes composed
    of multiple-choice, multiple-response, and/or true or false
    questions that will assess your comprehension of the main concepts
    behind DHIS2. The quizzes contribute 60% to your final grade.

You’ll have 3 attempts to complete each assignment or quiz. You’ll find
specific Instructions to complete the Customization Lab in module 4.

 In order to pass the course, an **overall grade of 80% is required**.

Successfully completing this course will enable you to participate in
the Level 1 - Analytics Tools and Level 1 - Design and Customization
Academies. You will learn more about Level 1 Academies at the end of the
course.

#### What is the course timeline

This course is self-paced, which means there are no set deadlines and
you can go through it at as fast or as slow as you prefer.  This course
does not currently have a set end date. In the event that an end date is
scheduled, you will be notified with enough time to finish your work in
the course.

#### How do I get support

The easiest way to ask for assistance is to make a post on the
discussion board. Click on the Discussion tab and select “Add a Post” in
order to add a new post. This board will be monitored by the course
instructors and other participants may also be able to assist in your
query.

    opinions of others
- **Help each other!** Reply to your peers’ questions and comments.
- Actively **up-vote** other posts if you think they are relevant, and
    other people will up-vote yours! The more upvotes your post has,
    the more likely it is to be seen.
- Choose the appropriate **category** when posting; this will keep the
    discussion forum orderly.
- Use a **descriptive and specific** title for your post. This will
    attract the attention of other learners with the same issue.
- See if someone **has already asked your question** before creating a new
    post.
- Use
    “[netiquette](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://elearningindustry.com/10-netiquette-tips-online-discussions&sa=D&ust=1605599915703000&usg=AOvVaw3jfDhGW_TzYJ0gj3ObZtFT)”
    or common writing practices for online communication. For example:

- Avoid TYPING IN ALL CAPS. Some people read this as shouting, even if
    that is not what you mean to convey.
- Avoid unnecessary symbols, abbreviated words, texting shorthand, and
    replacing words with numbers (e.g. Pls don’t rplce wrds w/#s).

PRO-TIP

- If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it
    in the future, you can **follow** it. To do that, view the post you want

## 2.3 The 1000 Most Vulnerable Days’ Use Case (7 min)

### Video - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

To better understand how DHIS2 can help us to collect, aggregate, and
analyze data in a public health context, we are going to use the example
of the 1000 **M**ost **V**ulnerable **D**ays (MVD’s) use case, which is aimed at
preventing childhood deaths by making informed decisions.

This use case will allow you to see how using DHIS2 will help you to
**track different health programs** for mothers and children, the **health
services** they receive, and see how the collected data inform **their
progress**.

In this video, you will start to get familiar with this use case, which
we'll use throughout the course.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4Z7J4MhfMQ4&sa=D&ust=1605599915711000&usg=AOvVaw1y4_ypzTvEnWA09xP7DdEt)

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

1. The 1000 most vulnerable days use case covers:

- From the time the child is born up until 3 years of age
- **From the time the child is conceived up until 2 years of age -
    correct**
- From the time a mother receives antenatal care and completes her
    post-natal care

EXPLANATION

The 1000 most vulnerable days covers both infant and mother from the
time from when the child was conceived to the child’s 2nd birthday. This
is a critical time for child development; the right nutrition for the
mother and for the child during this time can have a profound impact on
the child's growth and development and reduce disease risk, as well as
protect the mother's health. Elements linked to this use case are used
throughout this academy.

2. This use case is used to help us define: (select one or more)

- **The services that are provided to the mother and child**
- **The data we collect in relation to those services**
- **The outputs we create in relation to those services**

EXPLANATION

All 3 of these items are used to translate elements of the use-case (in
this case, a health-related use case) over to DHIS2. It is important to
identify what the key inputs and outputs are; this is often best
accomplished by understanding the use-case in detail.

## 2.4 Overview of DHIS2 (15 min)

### Video - Overview of DHIS2

In this overview, you will begin to familiarize yourself with some of
the key elements of DHIS2 that we will delve into throughout the course.

First, you will see options that allow you to **customize** your experience
with the platform.

Through examples, you will see the **different types of data** (numerical,
anonymous, or individual data) that can be collected, and the **reports**
that can be obtained.

Lastly, you will begin to hear about the 3 applications that we will see
in detail later on: **Pivot Tables** (used to create dynamic tables), **Data
Visualizer** (used to make charts) and **GIS** (use to make maps) based on the
data stored in the platform.

Note: GIS is currently called Maps starting with DHIS2 version 2.29

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr_oHSAY5ks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dkr_oHSAY5ks&sa=D&ust=1605599915714000&usg=AOvVaw33wJx7ViTQVHGRHT0nARGf)

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - Overview of DHIS2

1. We can collect different types of data directly within DHIS2 (for
    example, aggregate data or anonymous individual-level data)

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can collect different types of data directly within the
application. This includes aggregate data, event data (anonymous,
individual level data) and “Tracker” data (identifiable, individual
level data).

2. We can configure data quality checks by creating user-defined
    validation rules which check the data that is entered

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Mathematical rules, referred to as validation rules, can be defined by a
user in order to check the data that is being entered. This is one of
electronic methods checking data quality in DHIS2 and will be discussed
further in other sessions.

3. We can define the variables that we are collecting directly through
    the DHIS2 user-interface

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

As mentioned in the demo, it is a key principle of DHIS2 to allow the
user to customize what they are collecting directly through the
user-interface.

4. The outputs we create can not be given additional
    descriptions/interpretations directly within DHIS2

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

We can provide all of our outputs with additional descriptions and
discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2. This allows us to give
the item more context for when other users are reviewing the information
and will be discussed further in the analysis sessions.

5. The analyses/outputs that we create can not be shared with other
    users directly within DHIS2

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

The analyses/outputs that are created can be shared with other users
directly within DHIS2. This will be discussed more in later sessions.

## 2.5 DHIS2 Building Blocks (7 min)

### Video - DHIS2 Building Blocks

All data that is recorded in DHIS2 has at least **3 dimensions** that
describe it: _where_, which represents the geographic context and is
called the "**organisational unit**"; _what_, that is, what is the raw data
that we are collecting and is called "**data element**"; and _when_, that is,
the "**period**" in which the data is collected.

These are the building blocks of the DHIS2 data model, and are key to
understanding how the platform works.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaXLxIt7x5U](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPaXLxIt7x5U&sa=D&ust=1605599915717000&usg=AOvVaw02vW_xT6MT_LLaoWoB61EL)

the geographical location of the data

3. In DHIS2, data elements and indicators represent the same concept.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

In the building blocks presentation, it is noted that data elements and
indicators represent different concepts. Data elements are the raw data,
while indicators are calculated values.

4. Which of the following are data elements?  (select one or more)

- **Number of maternal deaths**
- Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000)
- **Number of positive malaria cases**

![](images/image133.png)

*Brief Note: In this table, there should not be more Malaria RDT
positives then Malaria RDT performed. If this is occurring, then there
is likely some issue with the quality of the data. For example, in
Afghan Dispensary for the period Oct - Dec 2015 in both the < 5 and >=
5 age group, we can see that there are more Malaria RDT positives then
Malaria RDT performed. Malaria RDT positives are a direct result of
performing an RDT test to detect malaria, and therefore the number of
Malaria RDT performed should always be >= the number of Malaria RDT
positives.

## 3.4 - GIS (Maps App) (115 min)

### Video - Presentation of the GIS (7 min)

A key tool of DHIS2 that will help you to **store**, **analyze**, and **present spatial data** from health programs is the **G**eographic **I** nformation System, **GIS**. (Note: this is referred to as **Maps** in later DHIS2 versions).

In this video, you will learn what GIS is in the context of DHIS2,
review its interface and review key concepts you will need to understand
in order to use this app effectively.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OByICemXX8M](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DOByICemXX8M&sa=D&ust=1605599915772000&usg=AOvVaw06t0FTUzp3EUBuMwmluRA6)

#### Learn more about the GIS (Maps) App:

[DHIS2 Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/2.25/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#about_gis)

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - Presentation of the GIS

1. What does GIS stand for?

- Geographical Identity Software
- **Geographical Information System**
- Geographical Information Structure

EXPLANATION

GIS stands for Geographical Information System. It is a common acronym
that is used when discussing or working with geographical data.

2. Which of the following represents one layer within a GIS?

In this video, we will review how to add thematic layers to our map.
Thematic layers are one of the most useful tools when reviewing maps as
they allow us to display different data directly on the map. Pay
attention to the differences between this interface and the one you used
on pivot tables and data visualizer tools when selecting data, periods,
and organisation units.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSYbaqeo-s](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DkjSYbaqeo-s&sa=D&ust=1605599915777000&usg=AOvVaw2s_VZDq0-RFP1pCLTdoIjg)

    used 7 classes as well as equal counts as the method. We should
    therefore select the same options in thematic layer 2.

![](images/image247.png)

- Click on "Update" to see the map displayed with the 2 related
    layers.

![](images/image119.png)

To save the map as a favorite:

your visualizations. The different options that are available to share
your saved interpretations with users and user groups will also be
discussed.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD17gKEksL0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DeD17gKEksL0&sa=D&ust=1605599915804000&usg=AOvVaw0uzeI6sPIHydcbii5fh9ak)

#### Activity 2 - Adding and reviewing descriptions

In the Data Visualizer app of [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915804000&usg=AOvVaw0GrGmrnjDp3f0Q19V5k6iE):

- Open up the previous favorite from your assignments which showed the
    number of maternal deaths by facility in 2016.

![](images/image230.png)

- Click on the triple arrows to bring up the **Details** and
    interpretation boxes.

![](images/image129.png)

- Add a description to the favorite if you have not already by
    clicking on the "Edit" button next to where it says "No
    description".

![](images/image6.png)

![](images/image169.png)

### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 3 of 5 (10 min)

It’s time to learn how to create a dashboard.

In this video, you will find all the steps you need to bring together
the different outputs you have created before (and saved as favorites)
using the data analysis tools (pivot tables, data visualizer, GIS) into
one dashboard. You will also see how to share your dashboard with other
users or groups of users.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TsUN4JRfE](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dm_TsUN4JRfE&sa=D&ust=1605599915805000&usg=AOvVaw0YzxJfyz-4Y4U0p4lnU2aw)

#### Activity 3 - Dashboards

Create a dashboard in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915806000&usg=AOvVaw18qAO5JpcwqwiaxEks00YU).
In order to add items to a dashboard, you will first have to create a
dashboard.

- Do this by clicking on the "Add" button.

![](images/image92.png)

A pop-up will appear in which you can provide the dashboard with a name.

- Click on "Create" when you have finished creating the dashboard.

![](images/image241.png)

To add items to the dashboard, use the search box located at the top. To
add an item click on the "Add" button next to the favorite. If you click
on the favorite name, it will take you directly to the favorite within
the app it was created rather than adding it to the dashboard.

![](images/image24.png)

- Add the following items to the dashboard (these are all taken from
    your previous exercises on data analysis):

- ANC 1st and 4th (by ANC1) Coverage, Trainingland, Jan 2015 - Dec
    2016 (Chart).
- Outpatient Attendance per 1,000 population, Trainingland, 2016
    (Chart).
- Delivery in Facility, Trainingland Districts, Last 4 Quarters (Pivot
    Table).
- Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery, Delivery in Facility and
    Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery (%), Trainingland
    Districts, July - December 2016 (Pivot Table).

![](images/image20.png)

![](images/image221.png)

![](images/image237.png)

You can move the items around and resize them to your liking in order to
get a feel for how the objects on the dashboard work. This is a very
useful tool for bringing together multiple analysis in a particular
thematic area together in order to be reviewed quickly. It is
particularly useful for program managers to receive at-a-glance
information regarding the programs they are responsible for.

### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 4 of 5 (10 min)

DHIS2 allows you to communicate with other users or groups of users
using the **message** application.  In the following video, you will see how
it works.

1. I have created a pivot table with the following dimensions:

- Data Element Group: Delivery

- Data Element: Births, Live

- Period: Last 4 Quarters

- Organisation Units: Trainingland Districts

In a real-life setting, a username will likely not be used to identify a
favorite.

Which of the following is a good name for the favorite? (select one)

- Live Births
- Deliveries in Trainingland, last 4 Quarters
- Live Births by Trainingland Districts, last 4 Quarters
- **Delivery_Live Births, Districts, last 4 Quarters**

EXPLANATION

The naming convention for favorites should include the program name and
the 3 core dimensions (what you are measuring, where it is coming from
and when it is coming from). This option includes all of these aspects.

2. I want to do some analysis comparing all of the following:

- All Facilities within my organisation unit hierarchy

- The last 12 months worth of data

- A combination of two data elements and one indicator

Which tool(s) should I use to display this information? (select one or
more)

- This type of analysis is not possible in DHIS2
- Data Visualizer
- **Pivot Table**
- GIS

The pivot table application is most suitable when you want to analyze
multiple dimensions of data, including multiple organisation units, time
periods and data types.

3. In DHIS2, I can add additional dimensions (such as Male/Female,
    Public/Private Facilities, etc.) to further break-down my data
    during analysis.

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Data can be broken down into different disaggregations in analysis. This
is shown in both the pivot table and data visualizer demonstrations.

4. If today's date is April 2, 2017 and I select a relative period of
    the last 5 years, which periods will be selected? (select one)

- 2011-2016
- **2012-2016**
- 2013-2017

EXPLANATION

Relative periods work backwards from the current date. In 2017, if we go
back 5 years we have 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

5. Using the features in DHIS2 I can: (select one or more)

- **Move analysis seamlessly between pivot tables, charts and maps**

applications, save outputs and add in descriptions and discuss
interpretations directly within DHIS2.

6. Favorites can be shared: (select one or more)

- **Using specific privileges for each item (such as edit/view)**
- **With other users within DHIS2**
- Directly from DHIS2 to social media

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as
well as sharing sessions. This allows us to specify exactly who sees the
outputs we have created.

7. With the DHIS2 dashboards you can: (select one)

- Have multiple dashboards
- Add favorites from analysis app
- Share dashboards with groups of users

- Is used to define which favorites can be seen by whom
- Can be used to share dashboards with other users
- Can be used to share interpretations with other users
- **All of the above**

EXPLANATION

Sharing can be used to customize the different outputs that can be seen
by each user. This was best demonstrated during the sharing session.

10. Sharing is typically controlled by: (select one)

- Selecting specific users in which to share objects
- **Selecting user groups in which to share objects**
- Sending items through messaging within DHIS2
- All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as

## 3.6 - Reports App and Reporting Rates (35 min)

### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 1 of 4 (9 min)

In this series of videos, you will learn how to use the reports app,
which contains a series of various reports that allow you to review
information about your system in unique formats when compared to the 3
core analysis apps (pivot table, data visualizer, GIS). In the first
video, you will learn about data set reports and resources within the
reports app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyAfzvYpOBk](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWyAfzvYpOBk&sa=D&ust=1605599915817000&usg=AOvVaw1sjHXfmHA2FB_0h1x7ThSS)

#### Activity 1 - Data Set Reports and Resources

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915818000&usg=AOvVaw2wqQegU3KuFZuclRsSPP9_), please run a data set report. In order to access data set reports:

- Go to Apps -> Reports -> Data Set Report

![](images/image255.png)

- Select the criteria for the data set report and click on "Get
    report" when ready. You can use the following as a guide:

- Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
- Period Type: Yearly
- Period: 2016
- Organisation Unit: Animal Region (you can try any org unit you like
    here)

![](images/image224.png)

- You will see the results for the dataset/period/organisation unit
    combination after you click on "Get report".

As discussed in the video, this gives you a layout of the data set as
you would see it in data entry. You can not edit the data here however,
and this can often serve as an ideal location to review the data in a
format that users are familiar with. The data can be aggregated within
this report, and therefore looked at within different levels of the
hierarchy as required.

![](images/image45.png)

- Access the resources by using the left-side sub-menu.

![](images/image74.png)

- You can view a resource by left-clicking on the item and selecting
    "View resource".

![](images/image145.png)

### Video - Reports App and Reporting Rates - Part 2 of 4 (5 min)

Next, you will learn how to use the **Organisation Unit Report**. You will
also learn how to use the **Reporting Rate Summary**.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8k-YDtHUIo](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Ds8k-YDtHUIo&sa=D&ust=1605599915819000&usg=AOvVaw1C8c81-wnGXrhRQfnbck_q)

#### Activity 2 - Organisation Unit Reports & Reporting Rate Summary

Organisation unit reports

Once in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915820000&usg=AOvVaw1mRUM8RaL6asmN5CEdrmRJ), you can access the organisation unit reports:

- By either selecting it from the side-menu within the reports app.

![](images/image158.png)

- Or by going to Apps -> Reports -> Organisation Unit Distribution
    Report.

![](images/image65.png)

In order to run the report:

- Define the criteria that you want to review first. In this example
    we can use the following:

- Report organisation unit: Food Region
- Group Set: Type

- Select "Get report", in order to run the organisation unit report.

![](images/image157.png)

The report will run and break down the facilities by their Type.

![](images/image167.png)

Reporting rate summary

Next we can run the reporting rate summary. We can access this:

- By either selecting it from the side-menu within the reports app.

![](images/image248.png)

- Or by going to Apps -> Reports -> Reporting Rate Summary.

![](images/image232.png)

- Select the criteria to run the report. In this example we can use

- Organisation Unit: Food Region
- Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
- Period Type: Quarterly
- Period: October- December 2016

- Leave "Based on complete data set registrations" selected. This
    means that the completeness is calculated based on the user
    submitting a completed data set within the data entry app. This will
    be discussed more in later sessions.

![](images/image194.png)

- Click on "Get report" in order to run the report and see the
    results.

![](images/image78.png)

### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 3 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to view reporting rates directly in
the pivot tables app. Reporting Rates are readily available within the
reports app, but you can also use the pivot tables app to review
reporting rates in DHIS2. This gives us the advantage of being able to
review multiple levels of organisation unit reporting rates in one
place.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DVMfCMVvlR3Q&sa=D&ust=1605599915822000&usg=AOvVaw1Zp3WZkYpl5kEjFbuIlK_r)

#### Activity 3 - Reporting Rates in Pivot Tables

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915823000&usg=AOvVaw2uEMtX1Y1SngHjCLQPLhfx), view the reporting rates within the pivot tables application. We will
select all of the metrics associated with the "Primary Health Care
Monthly Data Set".

- In the data tab select:

- "Data Sets" as the data type
- Select the various metrics followed by "Primary Health Care Monthly"
    as related to that metric. For example, select the "Reporting Rates"
    metric type followed by the "Primary Health Care Monthly (Reporting
    rates)" metric. Repeat this for all metric types

- Arrange the metrics you’ve selected according to the order you want
    them displayed within the pivot table.

![](images/image43.png)

- In the period tab select "Last year" as the period. The last year
    that is displayed will be different than what is shown in the video.

![](images/image217.png)

- In the organisation units tab select "Food Region" as the
    organisation unit and "Facility" as the organisation unit level.

![](images/image19.png)

- Alter the table layout so that the organisation units are displayed
    (ensure the organisation unit is not in the filter).

![](images/image219.png)

You can also open the table options and deselect "Show row totals" in
order to remove a nonsensical total in this case.

![](images/image116.png)

- Click on "Update" in order to see the output. Now you will see a
    much longer list of facilities within DHIS2. This image is only
    showing the top portion of the actual output.

![](images/image1.png)

You can view the same metrics in the Data Visualizer App, as you can see
in the Pivot Table app; while the GIS app will allow you to map the
Reporting Rate metric.

#### Questions

1. What does the data set report allow you to do? (select one)

- Review data as it would appear in data entry and allow you to
    update/edit the data
- **Review data as it would appear in data entry without allowing you to
    modify it**
- Output the data as a user-defined one-click report

EXPLANATION

Data set reports were highlighted during the reports app demo. It is
always a good idea to review data in the data set report rather than
data entry as you cannot modify data in this report.

2. Resources in DHIS2 can be used to: (select one or more)

- **Upload items such as data collection forms, guidelines or annual
    reports**
- **Add links to useful websites**
- Add additional assets that will increase DHIS2's performance

EXPLANATION

Resources were demonstrated in the reports app demo. Resources can be
useful for uploading external documentation and links to external
resources amongst other things. In this case, resources do not
correspond with additional resources to power the DHIS2 system.

3. Organisation unit distribution reports can be used to: (select one
    or more)

- **Provide a total count of organisation units that appear at certain
    levels within the hierarchy**
- **Display organisation units based on the groups they belong to**
- Show the geographic distribution of organisation units on a map

EXPLANATION

The organisation unit distribution report was demonstrated in the
reports app demo. This allows us to separate our organisation units into
user defined categories/groups as well as see the number of organisation
units at different levels of the hierarchy.

4. In DHIS2, the reporting rate completeness can be checked in: (select
    one or more)

- **The reports app by running the reporting rate summary**
- **Pivot Table, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in**
- **Data Visualizer, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in**

EXPLANATION

Reporting rates can be accessed in various parts of DHIS2. This includes
in the reports app as well as the different analysis apps.

# Module 4 - Introduction to DHIS2 Customization (6 hr)

## 4.0 Overview of the module (10 min)

## What is in this module

Now that you’ve had the opportunity to use DHIS2 with existing data, we
would like to shift focus and show you how to set up DHIS2 to capture
your own data. You’ll start by reviewing the **Design Principles** of DHIS2
so you can understand how DHIS2 works behind the scenes. Then, after
watching demonstrations, you will  create **Organisation Units**, also known
as our “where” dimension. **Organisation Units** form the backbone of data
collection as they associate all of the data you are capturing with a
particular location. You will be able to create these in a new training
environment, **DHIS2 Customization**. Next, you’ll look at how to create
**Data Elements** (our “what” dimension) These data elements define exactly
what information we want to capture. After you have reviewed the
creation of organisation units and data elements, you will review the
various **Data Collection** mechanisms available in DHIS2.  Finally, you’ll
look at **Data Sets** within DHIS2. **Data Sets** are a collection of data
elements and are assigned to certain organisation units. These are
conceptually similar to a paper data collection form. You will have the
opportunity to create a data set within the DHIS2 Customization training
environment.

The grading for this module is made up of two types of assessments:
first, you will find **5 quizzes that each make up 5% of your grade**, in
subsections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 & 4.6. You’ll have 3 attempts to complete
each quiz.

Second, in subsections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 you will find different sets of
assignments that need to be completed within the DHIS2 Customization
training environment. All of these assignments make up the **Customization
Lab**, which contributes **24%** to your final grade. The Course Staff will
assess your work once you complete all the tasks, mark the checklist,
and submit the form you will find in section 4.6.

Note that the **Customization Lab** assesses crucial knowledge and skills
and they are **graded as pass/fail**, which means that if you don't
successfully complete all the tasks, you will not get any partial
credit. This is because all of the Level 1 DHIS2 academies have some
aspects of configuration or maintenance within their course content,
that is why a basic understanding of this content is required for
participation in those courses.

To make the most out of your learning experience, we recommend that you
complete this module within a week of starting it.  

## 4.1 - Introduction to Collection and Customization (20 min)

### Video - Collection and Customization Intro (3 min)

In this introductory video, you will review the concepts that we will be
focusing on within this module. In this module, you will learn how to
create your own sets of Organisation Units, Data Elements and Data Sets.

You will also review how to use the Web Data Entry App, the Android Data
Capture App, SMS and PDF and other import options to upload data to
DHIS2.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqc-O4Z0dP8](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZqc-O4Z0dP8&sa=D&ust=1605599915829000&usg=AOvVaw2VutuPPGv8wPcDWOgCFrYF)

### Video - Introduction to DHIS2 Database Customization (8 min)

In the previous modules, you had the chance to practice what you learned
in Trainingland, where you performed all the assignments of modules 2
and 3.

In this module, you'll be using another training environment,  DHIS2
Customization to practice and get familiar with its options.

## 4.2 - Design Principles (20 min)

### Video - Design Principles Presentation (10 min)

As an open source platform, DHIS2 can be widely customized based on how
a given system is structured in any given country.

In this video, you’ll learn about the 4 key design principles of DHIS2:

1) all metadata can be modified through the user interface; 2)  DHIS2
can act as a single data repository; 3) data input does not equal data
output; and 4) the use of indicator-driven data analysis is encouraged.

#### Session Quiz - DHIS2 Customization (10 min)

1. DHIS2 is an off-the-shelf solution that requires no additional
    configuration upon installation.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

In both the DHIS2 History/Introduction and DHIS2 design principles
presentation, it is highlighted that DHIS2 is a generic solution that
needs to be tailored to fit local needs and requirements

2. You need to be a computer programmer (someone who knows computer
    languages) to take part in the configuration of DHIS2.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

Many aspects of DHIS2 configuration can take place directly through the
user-interface. This concept was discussed in the DHIS2 design
principles presentation and demonstrated through numerous configuration
sessions.

3. DHIS2 only supports the integration of data from one health program
    at a time.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

Multiple programs can be integrated into the DHIS2 platform together.
This is shown as both a concept and demo in the DHIS2 design principles
session.

4. Reports in DHIS2 are dynamic and can be the combination of data from
    several different data sources.

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Report can be a combination of data from multiple sources. This is shown
in the DHIS2 design principles session.

5. What is the difference between Data Elements and Indicators (select
    one)?

- They are both the same.
- Data Elements measure the coverage while indicators collects data
    values from the paper forms
- **Data Elements are the raw data while Indicators are calculated
    values/formulas**

EXPLANATION

The key difference here is that indicators represent calculated values,
and can typically be made up of several data elements. Data elements are
the raw items of data that are collected through routine processes.

## 4.3 - Organisation Units

### Video - Organisation Units Presentation (6 min)

In this video, you’ll be introduced to the  concepts of **organisation
units, organisation unit groups** and **organisation unit group sets**. These
form the backbone of our data collection as they assist in attaching
geographical locations to each data item that is stored in the system.
Some best practices in their management are introduced before discussing
their creation in the next series of videos.

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 1 of 4 (15 min)

After understanding how organisation units, organisation unit groups,
and organisation unit group sets are related, you will now learn **how
organisation units are created within DHIS2**. This will also include an
introduction to the maintenance app, which allows you to create various
items (referred to as metadata) within DHIS2.

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 2 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to take the organisation units you
have created and group them into **organisation unit groups**.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0hhs9dkj4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHb0hhs9dkj4&sa=D&ust=1605599915836000&usg=AOvVaw2bZXCUeY_dfCiv8uiNhNOx)

### Video - Organisation Units Demo - Part 3 of 4 (4 min)

Once you have created your organisation units and grouped them using
organisation unit groups, you can take on the last step, creating
**organisation unit group sets**. This video will cover this last step.
These 3 concepts combined can have a significant impact on how your data
is stored (as defined by the organisation units themselves) and what
types of outputs are possible (as **organisation unit groups** and **group
sets** allow you to disaggregate your data depending on how they have been
defined).

## Assignment - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets

### NOTE: These assignments belong to the Customization Lab (30 min)

### Customization Lab - Organisation Units, Data Elements & Data Sets

NOTE: The graded activity for module 4 is separated into 3 sets spread throughout module 4 that are graded together as one overall assignment, the Customization Lab. These assignments are to be completed within the DHIS2 Customization training environment. (30 min)

This series of assignments consist of 3 sets, which when added together make up 24% of your overall grade. This means that you will NOT be able to surpass the passing grade of 80% without completing this assignment. You must submit this assignment in order to receive a certificate for this course.

No partial credit will be granted if one of the sets of assignments is not completed. In order to pass this assessment, you must complete all 3 sets of the assignment for it to be considered complete and ready for grading. The 3 sets of this assignment are as follows:

- Set 1: Organisation Units (sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2, and 4.3.3)
- Set 2: Data Elements (sections 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3)
- Set 3: Data Sets (4.6.1 and 4.6.2)

At the end of the last assignment (4.6.2 within set 3) you will be asked to:

- Complete a progress check to confirm you have completed all of the individual steps within the 3 sets contributing to this assignment
- Send us a message indicating the email you used to register in the DHIS2 customization training environment.

With this information, the course team will validate the result of your assignments in the DHIS2 Customization training environment.

**It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignments will be granted.**

#### Assignments Module 4 - Set 1/3 - Organisation Units

**Instructions**

You need to be logged in [DHIS2 Customisation](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/cu1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915838000&usg=AOvVaw085V5o8wkKp1XGbyVBPExZ) to perform the following assignments.

You are tasked with creating a portion of the organisation unit
hierarchy within your country. The data should be entered at the correct
level so appropriate outputs can be created. The hierarchy in this
example country has 4 levels:

1. Country
2. Province
3. District
4. Facility

You will notice that the Country level organisation unit has been
created using your email address when you enter organisation unit
maintenance. This is so that you will only see the organisation units
that you are creating, rather than seeing everyone’s organisation units
together. Feel free to change the name of this organisation unit to
something else if you desire.

![](images/image17.png)

Please work on the following:

#### Assignment 4.3.1

Define and create the organisation unit.

Refer to the doc "[Exercise Worksheet - Creating Organisation unit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://academy.dhis2.org/assets/courseware/0bc4e40bbec535044faf30bd8ffdcbd0/c4x/HISP/DHIS2_Level1/asset/Exercise_Worksheet_-_Creating_Organisation_units.pdf&sa=D&ust=1605599915840000&usg=AOvVaw1RKh_5QTk7YJQSTl90wZpj)". Create organisation units with the following organisation unit hierarchy.

- 1 org unit at level 2 (Province)
- 3 org units at level 3 (District)
- 9 org units at level 4 (Facility)

#### Assignment 4.3.2

Create 4 organisation unit groups with the following names (and
belonging to the indicated group sets) and assign your above facilities
(the organisation units you have made at level 4) appropriately:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie.
SND_Hospital, SND_Health Center) when you create them in DHIS2. As
everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the
groups with unique names.

Group Set 1 : Facility Type

- Hospital
- Health center

Group Set 2 : Ownership

- Private
- Public

#### Assignment 4.3.3

Create two organisation unit group sets and assign them the appropriate
organisation unit groups:

Note: Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie.
SND_Type, SND_Ownership) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is
creating items in the same system, you need to provide the group sets
with unique names.

- Type
- Ownership

## Session Quiz - Organisation Units

Session Quiz - Organisation Units (20 min)  

This is a **graded quiz** and it is worth **5%** of your final grade. You have 3
attempts to pass this quiz.

Select the "**check**" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for
grading, select the "save" button. This will allow you to come back
later and resume the previously saved attempt.

#### Session Quiz - Organisation Units

1. Which one of these is not an organisation unit? (select one)

- Ermita Public Health Centre
- National Capital Region
- Manila Hospital
- **Malaria Elimination Project**

EXPLANATION

In the organisation units presentation, it is mentioned that multiple
concepts should not be mixed in the hierarchy

2. The organisation unit hierarchy: (select one)

- **Can use organisation unit groups to model additional hierarchies
    (for example, public/private facilities) for analysis**
- Only supports a limited number of levels
- Does not include any administrative layers outside of the facility

EXPLANATION

The concept of using organisation unit groups during analysis was shown
during the organisation units presentation. These are user defined as
was shown in the organisation unit demo.

Imagine you've created the following health facilities in DHIS2:

-Alberta Public Health Clinic

-Ontario Private Hospital

-Windsor Public Health Clinic

-London Public Hospital

As you can see there are two ownership types: private and public. There
are also two facility types: clinic and hospital.

Now you want to create organisation units groups for these facilities.

3. Which organisation unit groups would be best? (Select one or more)

- Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health
    Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public
    Hospital / Windsor Public Health Clinic
- **Health Clinic: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor Public Health
    Clinic AND Hospital: Ontario Private Hospital / London Public
    Hospital**
- **Publicly Owned Facilities: Alberta Public Health Clinic / Windsor
    Public Health Clinic / London Public Hospital AND Privately Owned
    Facilities: Ontario Private Hospital**
- Publicly Owned Facilities: Windsor Public Health Clinic / London
    Public Hospital AND Privately Owned Facilities: Ontario Private
    Hospital / Alberta Public Health Clinic

EXPLANATION

In this case, we can group the public health clinics and hospitals
together. This would be equivalent to defining the type of facility
within a system. We can also group public and private facilities
together, which would be equivalent to defining the ownership of these
facilities. This was discussed during the organisation unit
presentation.

4. When managing organisation units in DHIS2 through the user
    interface, we can define the following geographical features:
    (select one or more)

- **Latitude/Longitude (for example, the location of a facility)**
- **Geographical Symbols that define groups**
- Geographical Boundaries for regions, provinces, districts, etc.

EXPLANATION

This was shown when demoing the creation of organisation units. We can
add in lat/long coordinates of a facility during creation, and assign
symbols to organisation unit groups.

## 4.4 - Data Elements

### Video - Data Elements Design Principles  (12 min)

In this video, you will review the different types of data that can be
collected in DHIS2, including what we refer to as  routine,
semi-permanent and infrastructure data. You will also understand why it
is important to name data elements correctly; this will include a review
of best practices to follow when naming your data elements . Lastly,
you’ll see how to create data element groups and group sets.

#### Questions

1. Data Element names should: (select one)

- Be as long and descriptive as possible
- **Use self-contained names which describe the data effectively for
    output**
- Replicate the name on a paper form
- Be considered for input as a priority

EXPLANATION

When discussing data elements, we should always consider how they will
appear in output. This is discussed in more detail during the data
elements presentation.

2. I have a section of data elements that I am collecting all related
    to child delivery. I want to create the data element represented by
    the "Number of deliveries with complication" on the paper form. What
    is the most appropriate name for this data element? (select one)

- Number of deliveries with complication
- Complicated deliveries
- **Deliveries with complication**

EXPLANATION

During the data element presentation, naming principles were discussed.
Here, since we have a set of delivery data elements, it is better to
start the name off with "Delivery" as all the delivery types could
easily be found together in a list.

3. Data elements in DHIS2 can only be summed (added) together. No other
    operations, such as finding the average or counts of a particular
    value, can be performed.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

When creating data elements, we can define various aggregation types.
While sum tends to be a common option, other types can be used if
needed.

4. Data Element Groups are used for grouping together similar data
    elements for thematic analysis.

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Data element groups are user defined and assist us in finding our data
elements during analysis. Their use was shown throughout all the
analysis apps and their creation was shown in the data element creation
session.

## 4.5 - Data Collection

### Video - Data Collection Presentation (13 min)

The previous sets of assignments have allowed you to practice creating
organisation units and data elements. Prior to creating a data set, we
will demonstrate the different options that allow you to bring data into
DHIS2, including the Data Entry Web application, the Android Data
capture App, SMS Data Entry, PDF Data Upload, and Manual Data Import.
The data entry web app, android data capture app and SMS data entry all
use the concept of a dataset, which we will show you how to create after
you have reviewed various data collection mechanisms in more detail.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVutn5y9Q0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DonVutn5y9Q0&sa=D&ust=1605599915872000&usg=AOvVaw0mZwcLxZu8LElhtwE0q9bJ)

### Video - Data Collection - Web - Part 1 of 5 (5 min)

In this video, you’ll learn how to input data into DHIS2 using the Data
Entry Web application. We will use the 3 building blocks in this
session, selecting **Where** the data is entered, **When** the data is entered,
and **What** data is being entered.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIeWvibXZOw](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiIeWvibXZOw&sa=D&ust=1605599915873000&usg=AOvVaw0T9_v_1iXsYuwP3Xpz1rN-)

#### Activity 1 - Introducing the data entry app interface

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915873000&usg=AOvVaw3YnjAlSl9ekNr2ngOri5jE).

Familiarize yourself with the web data entry interface by opening a data
set, navigating the data set and entering some data values. In order to
open a data set you must first select the organisation unit, data set
and period that you would like to review.

- Select any organisation unit by either using the magnifying glass or
    expanding the tree on the left side of the screen.

![](images/image81.png)

The organisation unit that you select will be highlighted in an orange
color. It will also be displayed as the selected organisation unit in
the data entry pane.

After you have selected an organisation unit:

- Proceed to select a data set (in this example we will use the
    Primary Health Care Monthly data set)
- and Period (select a period in 2018 such as January 2018 or March
    2018 as these periods currently do not have any data; use the "Next
    year" button to select periods in 2018).

![](images/image182.png)

After selecting these parameters the data set will be displayed. Note:
If you select an organisation/period that already has data entered in it
already for 2018, try selecting a different organisation unit or period
in which no data has been entered.

![](images/image211.png)

- Enter the following practice data for the first section of the data
    set (labelled "Primary Health Care Monthly") to get a feel for using
    the data entry app. You can quickly navigate within the data entry
    app by using enter or tab to move forward/down and shift+tab to move
    backward/up between the various data element values when entering
    your data. Notice that when you enter values they will quickly
    change from yellow to green indicating they have been saved.

![Primary_Health_Care_Monthly](images/image134.png)

### Video - Data Collection - Web Demo - Part 2 of 5 (7 min)

In this video, you will see some additional options available when
entering values using the Data Entry Web App. This includes checking the
internal consistency of your data values through reviewing historical
values as well as using a concept called validation rules and reviewing
what changes have been made to your data using the audit trail.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq5SN-nCYpM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Daq5SN-nCYpM&sa=D&ust=1605599915875000&usg=AOvVaw1_hoD9tisBq9CKyHpJ5HPM)

### Activity 2 - Reviewing the data element history, audit trail and validation rules

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915875000&usg=AOvVaw0B4JU_f4yGFmhwwGH7_B2Z).

Start this activity by running validation for the data that you have
previously entered according to the example data provided in Activity 1:

- You can select "Run validation" at either the top or bottom of the
    data entry page.

![](images/image59.png)

When you run validation, a pop-up screen will prompt you that some
validation rule violations have been detected.

![](images/image67.png)

This includes:

- Birth live >= Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery: the
    amount of infants that are breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery
    is a subset of the total live births within a facility. Therefore
    live births should always be greater than or equal to the number of
    infants breastfeed within 1 hour after delivery.
- Delivery by Caesarean Section <= Delivery by skilled birth
    attendant: Caesarean Sections are a subset of total deliveries
    performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less
    than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth
    attendant.
- Delivery with complication <= Delivery by skilled birth attendant:
    Deliveries with complication are a subset of total deliveries
    performed by a skilled birth attendant, and therefore should be less
    than or equal to the deliveries performed by a skilled birth
    attendant.

Let us fix these validation rules before continuing.

- Update the following data elements to fix the issues with
    validation. In this case, we could imagine some simple data entry
    errors occurring. In the first example (Birth live) a 6 was entered
    instead of a 9. In the second example (Delivery by skilled birth
    attendant) the 7 was not entered at the end of the data value.

![fixing validation rules](images/image231.png)

After you have edited the values:

- run the validation again. This time, you should see a successful
    result.

![](images/image115.png)

- Double click on the value for Birth live (194) after you have
    corrected it.

This will bring up the data history page for you to review.

![](images/image93.png)

- You can also select “Audit Trail” to review any changes you have
    made to the data element value.

![](images/image41.png)

### Video - Data Collection - Web - Part 3 of 5 (2 min)

To finish the data entry process, you’ll see how data entry is completed
and how it relates to the reporting rates that are generated in DHIS2.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxEWOkkJumQ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnxEWOkkJumQ&sa=D&ust=1605599915877000&usg=AOvVaw3UVkltP-Vq3rc91eTUpnzx)

#### Activity 3 - Completing data entry

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915878000&usg=AOvVaw3xBljrPkSQ86YgLeXuSTnv).

- Complete the data entry process by clicking on the complete button
    for the organisation unit/period/data set combination you have been
    working with.

![](images/image140.png)

After you click on the “Complete” button, it will be grayed out. This
will now contribute to being a complete report when you run the
reporting rate completeness later on in DHIS2.

![](images/image70.png)

- Re-load the data entry application
- and re-select the organisation/period/data set combination you were
    previously editing.

![](images/image86.png)

With the data set displayed:

- Scroll down to the bottom of the data entry page. You will now see
    the "Completed by" tag underneath the complete button.
- You can click on "See Details" to bring up additional information on
    the person who entered this data.

![](images/image76.png)

![](images/image97.png)

### Video - Data Collection - Web Demo - Part 4 of 5 (2 min)

In this video you’ll see how it is also possible to use the Data Entry
application offline without an internet connection and synchronize it
later in areas with limited connectivity.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaC5gBP3Ph0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DuaC5gBP3Ph0&sa=D&ust=1605599915879000&usg=AOvVaw1zQdkUwZc4qgNavbDyTx5h)

#### Activity 4 - Offline data entry

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url? q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915879000&usg=AOvVaw0671czPKPnnm1IIXXLf3A1).

- To perform offline data entry, disconnect from the internet.

DHIS2 will prompt you indicating "You are offline, data will be stored
locally".

![](images/image30.png)

- Try navigating around and selecting different organisation units at
    the facility level.

You can also change between the different data sets and periods. Note
that you will not see any data that is only stored online; therefore
most of the organisation unit/data set/period combinations you select
will not display data until you are back online.

- Enter some data in offline mode for the primary health care monthly
    data set using a period in 2018 as you did before for the
    Immunization section of the form.

![offline data entry form](images/image32.png)

- Re-connect  to the internet. A prompt will indicate that "There is
    data stored locally, please upload to server".
- Click on the Upload button to upload the data.

![](images/image164.png)

After the upload is complete, you will receive a prompt indicating that
the "Upload to server was successful".

![](images/image23.png)

### Video- Data Collection - Web Demo - Part 5 of 5 (4 min)

In this video, you’ll see a summary of how to use the Data Entry Web app
in order to enter data into DHIS2.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRIh4GasqIw](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DkRIh4GasqIw&sa=D&ust=1605599915881000&usg=AOvVaw0ULly3L_B8ssrIOJN2eJNs)

### Video - Data Collection - Android - Part 1 of 3 (6 min)

In this video, you’ll learn how to input data using the DHIS2 Android
Data Capture App.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbdQrdSbxyU](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DSbdQrdSbxyU&sa=D&ust=1605599915881000&usg=AOvVaw1-prLoM9QOPoZ_X9Om3Khi)

#### Activity 1 - Installing, logging in and entering data using an Android device

To perform this activity, you will need an Android device (at this
point, only Android devices are supported)

On the Android device, you will need to install the app:

- Navigate to the play store on your phone and find the "Data Capture
    for DHIS2" app in the play store:
    [https://play.google.com/store/apps/**Details**?id=org.dhis2.mobile&hl=en](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://play.google.com/store/apps/**Details**?id%3Dorg.dhis2.mobile%26hl%3Den&sa=D&ust=1605599915882000&usg=AOvVaw32zEnMF5wAc7gMDtLV6FLp)
- Install the app when you find it in the play store.

![](images/image235.png)

![](images/image256.png)

- Fill in the details as follows:

- Server URL:
    [https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1&sa=D&ust=1605599915882000&usg=AOvVaw3oMX0-nIUDgCO6cr3plF-l)
- Username: Select a user-name from the table below (for example, if
    my last name starts with J, I would use android5)
- Password: Password1

![](images/image122.png)

Note: For the username, several have been created for this exercise.
Please select an account according to your last name. This is being done
so that we can separate the data that is entered by the android devices
across the various organisation units within Trainingland so it is
easier for each user to find their data when they log in through their
web browser later on.

![Android data capture table](images/image62.png)

- Click on the "Log in" button to log in. You will see this interface
    initially.
- Select "Choose organisation unit".
- and select an organisation unit to continue.

![](images/image54.png) ![](images/image227.png)

- Next, tap "Choose data set".
- and select the "Syndromic Surveillance" data set.

![](images/image88.png) ![](images/image79.png)

Next select "Choose period" and select a period of your choice.

![](images/image174.png) ![](images/image200.png)

The information will fill in on the Android device.

- Make a note of the organisation unit/data set/period combination you
    have selected so you can verify the data has been uploaded later on.
- Tap on the summary box which contains the combined information of
    your data set, period and organisation unit selection.

![](images/image90.png)

- You can now proceed to enter some data.
- Click on the Save button to send the data to DHIS2.

If you swipe down your notification tray, you will see the message
"Import process completed successfully" indicating the data has been
successfully sent to DHIS2.

(Note: If there is data already present in the organisation
unit/period/data set combination you have selected, please try to select
a different organisation unit/period combination with no data present)

![](images/image44.png) ![](images/image186.png)

- Log back into Trainingland through your web browser on your computer
    and make sure your data has been imported successfully online.
- Find the organisation unit/data set/period combination you selected
    on the Android device. In the example above this was the following:

![](images/image250.png)

- Review the data entry page and see if the data is present.

The data set should also be marked as complete and have the details of
the user who completed the data entry using the android device.

![](images/image82.png)

### Video - Data Collection - Android Demo - Part 2 of 3 (7 min)

Similar to the Data Entry Web app, it is also possible to enter data
into the Android app without an internet connection. Data is stored on
the Android device until an internet connection is restored, allowing
the data to be synchronized.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twu1pD4hVOs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dtwu1pD4hVOs&sa=D&ust=1605599915885000&usg=AOvVaw0wBvsPKjD3N-uT56JFxBdx)

#### Activity 2 - Entering data offline using an Android device

In order to start this activity, you must first ensure you are logged in
to the android device with your internet connection active. If you try
to log-in without an internet connection it will not work.

After you have logged in:

- Turn off the wi-fi and mobile data on your phone to ensure you no
    longer have any connectivity.

![](images/image83.png)

Now you can proceed to:

- select an organisation unit/period/data set combination
- and enter some data offline.

Remember not to log-out of the android app while performing this
activity or you will lose the data you have entered!

![](images/image152.png) ![](images/image128.png)

- After you click on Save you will see that you do not receive any
    notification that the data was imported successfully.

![](images/image87.png)

- Turn your wi-fi or mobile data back on in order to upload the data.

When you turn your data back on you will receive the notification.

![](images/image11.png)

- You can log back into Trainingland through your web browser on your
    computer to check if the data you entered offline on the android
    device is now online.

In the offline example the following organisation unit/data set/period
combination was selected:

![](images/image120.png)

- Review the data entry page and see if the data is present.

The data set should also be marked as complete and have the details of
the user who completed the data entry using the android device.

![](images/image98.png)

### Video - Data Collection - Android Demo - Part 3 of 3 (3 min)

In this video, we will review a summary of the concepts we have
discussed in this session regarding the Android data capture app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAJ09XUkqa4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlAJ09XUkqa4&sa=D&ust=1605599915887000&usg=AOvVaw3U_debTeU1hZOq7G_xT2PU)

### Video - Data Collection - PDF and CSV Import (10 min)

In this video, you will see how to enter data from PDF and CSV files
into DHIS2.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hsOjyGwU2o](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5hsOjyGwU2o&sa=D&ust=1605599915888000&usg=AOvVaw1bYBZE4ZQLtGhfyHlb8790)

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - PDF and CSV Import

1. PDF forms can be automatically generated by DHIS2 in order to enter
    data offline

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

PDF forms can be generated within the data set maintenance application
to allow users to enter their data completely offline. There are some
drawbacks to this however as changes in the PDF will not be reflected
online until the PDF is either re-imported or the changes are manually
made online as well.

2. DHIS2 can natively import an Excel file in any format

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can natively import a CSV file. CSV files can be made in any
number of applications (including Excel). The CSV format that DHIS2
recognizes is specific, and the file that is imported must follow this
format if using the built in tools that DHIS2 provides for importing
data.

3. DHIS2 has functionality to import large amounts of data at once so
    this data does not need to be re-entered again

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 supports several different file formats when importing data. Using
these formats, large amounts of data can be imported together. This can
be a one-time occurrence when migrating from a legacy system or a
routine occurrence where data is normally being brought into DHIS2 from
other sources.

## Session Quiz - Data Collection

### Session Quiz - Data Collection (20 min)

This is a **graded quiz** and it is worth **5%** of your final grade.

You have **3 attempts** to pass this quiz.

Select the "**check**" button to submit your answers.

If you want to save your current response without submitting it for
grading yet, select the "save" button. This allows you to come back
later and resume the attempt.

#### Session Quiz - Data Collection

1. The main function of Data Sets in DHIS2 is to: (select one)

- Create dynamic outputs
- Group together data elements for analysis
- **Capture Data**
- Analyse data quality

EXPLANATION

Data Sets are used to capture data from different sources in DHIS2.
Outputs are not directly tied to data sets and can be a mix of different
data sets as needed.

2. Some different methods for me to input data using DHIS2 include:
    (select one or more)

- **Performing a manual import of data**
- **Using an Android Device**
- Scanning Data directly from a paper form
- **Using the data entry app within DHIS2**

EXPLANATION

Different types of data collection methods were shown throughout Module
4. DHIS2 does not have the ability to scan in results from a paper form
directly however.

3. In the web data entry app, you can view the following: (select one
    or more)

- **Data element history (referring to the history of a particular item)**
- **Audit trail (showing you changes made to a particular item)**
- The distribution of the data over a particular period, such as
    variance or standard deviation

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 does allow for you to examine data distributions such as variance
and standard deviation, but this cannot be done directly in the data
entry web app. The audit trail and data element history were shown in
the data entry web app session.

4. In the web data entry app what type of quick quality checks can be
    performed? (select one or more)

- **That individual minimum and maximum limits are not violated**
- **Validation rules that run user defined conditions which check that certain logical, mathematical criteria are met**
- **That values are being entered in the correct format (ie. text cannot be entered in a numerical field)**

EXPLANATION

In the web data entry app, various quality checks can be run while
entering data. These were shown in the data entry web app session.

5. Android Data Entry can be performed offline without an internet
    connection

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

As long as you are logged in to the Android app (and do not log out) and
you can continue to enter data directly on the Android device without an
internet connection.

6. Alternative methods of bringing data into DHIS2, such as importing
    the data or using PDF files, are possible

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Other methods of bringing data into DHIS2 are possible. This allows for
transferring data from legacy systems or creating a data warehouse with
data that is in different formats.

## 4.6 - Data Sets

### Video - Data Sets - Data Set Creation - Part 1 of 3 (14 min)

In the following series of videos, you will learn how data sets are
created in DHIS2. This process includes reviewing the original paper
form, identifying the mandatory fields required when creating a data
set, assigning your data elements that you have created to your data set
and assigning data sets to organisation units and user roles.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EloVtQ0XALs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DEloVtQ0XALs&sa=D&ust=1605599915894000&usg=AOvVaw3b881uaB5T-OkllNfecnVC)

| TB07.19 Number of patients examined for follow-up                                               | *     |
| MAL02.01 Malaria Slide (Tested)                                                                 | *     |

#### Assignment 4.6.1 - Create a default data set

Part 1

Using the data elements you have already created in the data element
exercise, recreate this data set as a monthly data set collected at the
facility level (assign the data set to the facilities you have created).
Note that the Data set has already been created for you when you created
your account. You can edit it and provide it with a better name if
desired. You will need to edit the data sets properties, add the data
elements that you have created to this data set and assign it to an
organisation unit. This is to get around the issue of managing user
privileges that was discussed in the video demonstration, as this data
set is by default assigned to your user.

Part 2

Navigate to the data entry app and select an organisation unit which you
have assigned the data set to. Select a period and the data set you have
created to confirm it has been created successfully.

#### Assignment 4.6.2 - Create a section data set

Part 1

Divide the data set above into 3 sections as depicted below. You can
either modify the data set you have created in Part 1 or make a new data
set if you like.

### Feedback - DHIS2 Customisation (3 min)

Please take 2 or 3 minutes to complete this feedback survey once you are
done with the Module 4. Your careful response will have a real impact on
how courses like this are run. Thank you!

Embedded survey

# Module 5 - Introduction to Tracker (3 hr)

## 5.0 Overview of the module (5 min)

### What is in this module

So far, you have seen how DHIS2 can be used for the reporting, analysis
and dissemination of data (module 2); for data analysis using pivot
tables, charts and maps (module 3); and have also seen how DHIS2 can be
customized to meet the needs of a particular country or organization
(module 4).

In Module 5, you will learn how data from real patients are entered into
DHIS2 using two applications: Event capture and Tracker capture.

By watching these demonstrations, you will see how to capture data
excluding personal information, but still collected at the individual
level, by reviewing the Event model in DHIS2. You will also learn how
individual, personal information is collected using the Tracker model in
DHIS2. You will also learn how to analyze this data using the analysis
tools that you are already familiar with. Like in the previous modules,
you will be prompted to perform some exercises using Trainingland
following the steps shown in the videos.

At the end of subsection 5.4 you will find a graded assignment divided
into 3 steps. This graded assignment contributes 4% of your final grade.
After these assignments have been completed, you will find the last
graded quiz of the course which counts towards 5% of your final grade.
This module is therefore responsible for 9% of your overall grade
between the assignment and quiz.

We estimate that you will take about 3 - 4 hours to view all the videos
and complete both ungraded and graded learning activities. This will
vary slightly for each learner but should give you a good indication of
the time required to complete this module.

## 5.1 - Tracker Introduction Presentation

### Video - Tracker Intro Presentation (5 min)

So far, we have been dealing with reviewing the concepts related to the
collection, analysis and dissemination of aggregate data. Source data
and patient level information is often not collected this way however,
and the need for more transactional, individual-based data collection
and analysis mechanisms makes itself readily apparent within a variety
of sectors.

That’s the purpose of DHIS2 Tracker, which is divided into 2 main
models: **Event** and **Tracker**. In this video, we will provide a brief
background on this Tracker concept as well as contrast the Event and
Tracker models as it relates to collecting individual data.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3Os3E6EMEU](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-3Os3E6EMEU&sa=D&ust=1605599915911000&usg=AOvVaw2z9rrDb9f76t-QxuiUBH9d)

## 5.2 - Event Programs

### Video - Introduction to Event Programs and Event Capture (5 min)

Event Programs allow you to collect data about a specific and isolated
event that will later feed aggregated data models into DHIS2.
Information on event programs is collected via the Event Capture app. In
this video, we will discuss event programs and the event capture app,
utilizing real life use cases to demonstrate where event programs can be
practical to use in practice.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqxee03vqTs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DNqxee03vqTs&sa=D&ust=1605599915912000&usg=AOvVaw0ZuQ7qM6HYDa34aEe660cX)

### Video - Event Capture Demo - Part 1 of 4 (10 min)

Now that you understand the purpose of the Event Capture app, let’s see
how it works within DHIS2.

In this video, you will review the **Event Capture interface**, understand
how collected data is displayed within the app and learn how to filter
and edit entered data for specific programs.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IojjGyrURU](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-IojjGyrURU&sa=D&ust=1605599915913000&usg=AOvVaw0nPEw7TRiphvEoiahHKWEy)

#### Activity 1 - Introducing the event capture interface

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915913000&usg=AOvVaw0Rc1biLH0pPDCHYXdiM4jW).

- Familiarize yourself with the event capture interface.
- Navigate to event capture by selecting Apps -> Event Capture.

![](images/image125.png)

- Select any of the organisation units at the facility level within
    Trainingland.

![](images/image55.png)

- Select Malaria case management as the program. Note that you do not
    select a period; this differs from the aggregate data entry app in
    which a period must be selected before any data appears.

![](images/image201.png)

After selecting a program, the related events will appear.

![](images/image118.png)

You can try the following functionality to see how it works:

- Print List: Prints the list of events that is displayed on the page
    you are viewing within the event capture app. Click on the "Print
    list" button in order to view the output.

![](images/image179.png)

- Download events: This will download the events that are displayed in
    event capture in one of XML, JSON or CSV file formats directly to
    your computer.

![](images/image3.png)

- Show/hide columns: This will add additional columns to the event
    capture front page. These columns in event capture represent the
    data elements which are associated with the program you have
    selected. You can access this using the "Show/hide columns" button.

![](images/image171.png)

If you left-click on an event, some options will appear. The event will
only have an audit history if it has been changed. You can try to select
some of the options to see the effect they have on the event.

![](images/image146.png)

### Video - Event Capture Demo - Part 2 of 4 (10 min)

In this video, you’ll see the step-by-step process required to **register
a new event** in the Event capture app and how **data validation** can be
incorporated when working with this type of data

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THD3a6UJN9A](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DTHD3a6UJN9A&sa=D&ust=1605599915915000&usg=AOvVaw2T3w4b3zx1ZiLALW3tm6rh)

#### Activity 2 - Register a new event

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915916000&usg=AOvVaw22m5VFQF8vvO_tV-wYrsAw).

- Select any of the organisation units at the facility level within
    Trainingland and select the SARA RCH program.

![](images/image130.png)

- Left-click "Register event" to create a new event.

![](images/image4.png)

- You will need to select a report date before you begin this process.

You can select any report date of your choosing. This differs from
aggregate data entry, in which you select a predefined period. For
events, any report date can be selected.

![](images/image124.png)

After selecting the report date, the questions within the program will
appear. Note that you only see two questions as the remainder are hidden
by the logic associated with the survey (or, in DHIS2 terms, the program
rules).

- Fill in the following data.

Note that program rules should be triggered when you select the
following questions:

- Does this facility offer family planning services?

- Triggers the follow-up questions related to family planning services

- Received any family planning training in the last two years?

- Triggers follow-up asking how many trained

- Received any training in adolescent sexual and reproductive health
    in the last two years?

- Triggers follow-up asking how many trained

- Does this facility stock contraceptive commodities at this service
    site?

- Triggers the follow-up questions related to contraceptive
    commodities

![](images/image51.png)

![](images/image106.png)

![](images/image33.png)

![](images/image56.png)

After entering this data you would have seen how some of the program
rules work to display various items within the event capture form. If
you followed along with the exercise and scroll back up to the top, you
will notice some indicators have been calculated and some validation
warnings have appeared along the right side.

![](images/image49.png)

- Change the value for "How many staff are in this facility" to 15.

![](images/image197.png)

This will remove the validation warnings and the indicators will no
longer be > 100%.

![](images/image168.png)

### Video - Event Capture Demo - Part 3 of 4 (5 min)

In this video, you will learn how the offline functionality of the Event
Capture app works. This allows you to enter event data into event
capture without an internet connection and synchronize it when your
connection is restored.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPm-ffywlr0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DQPm-ffywlr0&sa=D&ust=1605599915918000&usg=AOvVaw0nB4cP7dWKl3vDpl7cr0Dn)

- To perform offline data entry, disconnect from the internet.

DHIS2 will prompt you indicating "You are offline, data will be stored
locally".

![](images/image203.png)

- Try navigating around and selecting different organisation units at
    the facility level. You can also change between the Malaria case
    management or the SARA RCH program. Note that previous events will
    not be displayed in offline mode.

In the SARA RCH program:

- Register a new event with the following **Details**.
- Click on "Save and go back" when you are finished.

![](images/image85.png)

- Re-connect  to the internet. A prompt will indicate that "There is
    data stored locally, please upload to server".
- Click on the Upload button to upload the data.

![](images/image198.png)

After the upload is complete, you will receive a prompt indicating that
the "Upload to server was successful".

![](images/image27.png)

### Video - Event Capture Demo - Part 4 of 4 (3 min)

In this video, we will review all of the key concepts we have discussed
related to the Event Capture app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi3iS3SsCLg](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPi3iS3SsCLg&sa=D&ust=1605599915921000&usg=AOvVaw0fB3llw4wC66I1PWMJTuru)

## 5.3 - Tracker Programs

### Video - Tracker Programs - Tracker Programs Presentation (6 min)

In this video, you will be given an overview of Tracker programs in
DHIS2. Tracker programs allow us to collect data that is attached to
identifiable information. This allows this type of model to be used for
the longitudinal tracking of services, commodities or other items based
on the needs of the program performing this tracking.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEEfs06GRB0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DIEEfs06GRB0&sa=D&ust=1605599915922000&usg=AOvVaw2WM0DXUoL5sZNqZBJdEjsh)

### Video - Tracker Capture Demo - Part 1 of 5 (11 min)

In the first video of this series, you will start to get familiar with
the **Tracker Capture app interface**, learn to **filter** cases within a
program and perform simple and complex **searches** for records that already
exist in the system. We will be using an Antenatal Care program example
in order (ANC) to show how this works in DHIS2

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H0vrs-0ra4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D_H0vrs-0ra4&sa=D&ust=1605599915922000&usg=AOvVaw0z5Nc-FkpJDOOZESrpVZlP)

#### Activity 1 - Introducing the tracker capture interface

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915923000&usg=AOvVaw3i7wUDpF-1YZTYH90Q1kO0).

- Navigate to tracker capture by selecting Apps -> Tracker Capture

![](images/image213.png)

- For this example, select the "Cardinal Hospital Gateway PHC"
    organisation unit.

![](images/image48.png)

- Select the ANC (Antenatal care) Example program from the dropdown.

![](images/image16.png)

This will display the entities (people in this case) associated with the
program.

- Try the various filters to see how they work. From left to right,
    the filters are the following:

- Only those with an event today: Filters entities who have an event
    scheduled today.
- Any enrollment status: Filters all entities within the program
    regardless of their status.
- Only those with active enrollment: Filters all entities that are
    currently receiving services within the selected program.
- Only those with completed enrollment: Filters those entities
    identified as having completed the set of services offered by the
    selected program.
- Only those with cancelled enrollment: Filters those entities
    identified as having cancelled their enrollment within the selected
    program (they did not receive the complete set of services and
    dropped out of the program).

![](images/image218.png)

- Download Tracked Entity List: This will download the tracked
    entities that are displayed in tracker capture in one of XML, JSON
    or CSV file formats directly to your computer. It is similar to
    downloading events in event capture.

![](images/image131.png)

- Show/hide columns: This will add additional columns to the tracker
    capture front page. These columns in tracker capture represent the
    attributes that are associated with the program you have selected.
    This differs from event capture where you saw the data elements here
    (event programs do not have attributes associated with them). You
    can access this using the "Show/hide columns" button.

![](images/image37.png)

- Change the filter back to "Any enrollment status" and try to search
    for a specific entity. You can try a simple search by typing the
    name “Janella Thomas” in the search box.

![](images/image80.png)

This will return the following entity

![](images/image148.png)

You can try the advanced search as well by clicking on the drop down
arrow next to the search field.

- You can use the following Details to find the person:

- First Name: Sarah
- Last Name: Phi
- Age: 52
- Phone number: 0873637277

![](images/image190.png)

This will return the following entity.

![](images/image94.png)

### Video - Tracker Capture Demo - Part 2 of 5 (10 min)

In this video, you will learn **how to register a new entity (we are using**
**person in this example) to a specific health program** using the Tracker
capture app. You will also become familiar with the **Tracker dashboard**.
This dashboard comprises all the data of one individual tracker record.
From the dashboard, you will learn how to enter Tracker data.

In this video, you’ll also see what a “**widget**” is within DHIS2 Tracker.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q-_Nc4XThQ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-Q-_Nc4XThQ&sa=D&ust=1605599915926000&usg=AOvVaw3ofRKxHFuj9uBq182D52FC)

#### Activity 2 - Register a new entity, review the dashboard and enter tracker data

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915927000&usg=AOvVaw3wAzNH-1xrzb1XHu5tIRN_).

In the Tracker Capture app:

- Select any organisation unit at the facility level and select the
    ANC Example as the program.

![](images/image111.png)

![](images/image206.png)

- Select Register to proceed to the registration page.

![](images/image222.png)

- In the Enrollment Page, we should try and enter unique details. You
    can make up some details of a person in order to fit the attributes
    associated with the program.
- To go through the ANC program, select an ANC registration date that
    is in the past. In the example here, January 1, 2016 has been
    selected. This will allow you go through all the ANC program stages
    within the ANC Example program.

![](images/image58.png)

- When you have entered all of the details and changed the ANC
    registration date, click on "Save and continue." This will take you
    to what is referred to as the tracked entity dashboard.

Here have a look around the dashboard. The elements that were identified
in the video demo are all present here. You can add/remove widgets,
review the details of the person you have registered, review the
timeline for data entry and enter data.

- To add/remove widgets click on the gear icon then select show/hide
    widgets.

![](images/image162.png)

- You can then select the widgets to add/remove by clicking on the
    check-boxes next to their name. Do not remove the Timeline Data
    Entry widget.

![](images/image147.png)

- Enter some data for the first program stage. To start this process,
    scroll down to the Timeline Data Entry widget. The first program
    stage is already selected and the relevant data entry page open.

The following data can be used as a guideline:

![](images/image9.png)

- When finished with the data entry, click on the orange "Complete"
    button to complete this event.
- You will receive a prompt asking for your confirmation. Click on the
    "Complete" button to complete the first event.

![](images/image143.png)

After doing this, the data entry for the first event will close, the
event will change to grey and it will be marked as completed in the data
entry timeline.

![](images/image165.png)

### Video - Tracker Capture Demo - Part 3 of 5 (11 min)

In this video,  you will learn how to **add new events** to a Tracker
record, understand the color legend within the data entry widget and
review how to use additional widgets including  the **profile** and
**relationships** widgets.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNg61JBzd2A](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DSNg61JBzd2A&sa=D&ust=1605599915929000&usg=AOvVaw3gv0B21vBs455Xm_iSmVsi)

#### Activity 3 - Entering data for new events and completing the program

Please do this activity in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915929000&usg=AOvVaw0_Ab2Krjpk5YaAQqTdrz5u).

From the previous activity:

- Select the 2nd event and continue to enter data related to the
    person that you have registered.

![](images/image89.png)

- Complete the event and confirm the event is completed. Now you will
    be asked to schedule a follow-up visit for the mother. By default,
    the next visit is scheduled 60 days from the previous visit. We can
    use the default date here and click on "Save" to schedule the next
    visit.

![](images/image35.png)

A new event will appear in the timeline according to the date in which
you have scheduled the event.

![](images/image108.png)

- Scroll back up to the top of the dashboard page and select
    "Complete". This blue complete button will complete the person’s
    enrollment in the entire program. In the context of this program, it
    is stating that the mother has received all of her ANC visits and
    will not receive anymore ANC related to this pregnancy (in reality
    hopefully information on more than 2 visits would have been
    completed).

![](images/image75.png)

- It will ask you to confirm if you want to complete the selected
    enrollment. Select "Yes" to continue.

![](images/image46.png)

The dashboard for the person will close the enrollment. In order to
enter additional Details you will need to Reopen the person’s enrollment

### Video - Tracker Capture Demo - Part 4 of 5 (5 min)

When working with Tracker, we can register entities into the system
without associating them with a particular service. This can be
particularly useful when trying to establish a registry of some kind. In
this video, you will learn how to create new records in Tracker capture
that can be associated with programs as required after the record has
been created.

In this video you’ll see a summary of the key concepts we have discussed
as related to Tracker capture.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3fULNNc2bM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dv3fULNNc2bM&sa=D&ust=1605599915934000&usg=AOvVaw1x57xtvD3QKgW_Jm_x30aY)

## 5.4 - Event Data Analysis

### Video - Event Data Analysis Demo - Part 1 of 4 (7 min)

You have now had the opportunity to review how individual records are
entered and managed using both the event and tracker capture apps.

In this series of videos, we will review how you can analyze aggregated
outputs generated from this data using the apps you are already very
familiar with, pivot table and data visualizer.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VZZK09acN0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3VZZK09acN0&sa=D&ust=1605599915934000&usg=AOvVaw0FaszDSLHtBvexQQKPJS6z)

#### Activity 1 - Introducing program indicators

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915935000&usg=AOvVaw2F0xFFZOGuKzAVxedVWet3),
create a pivot table including the program indicators:

- number of facilities offering ANC
- number of facilities offering family planning services

In the data tab select:

- "Program Indicators" as the data type
- "SARA RCH" as the Program
- "# of facilities offering ANC" & "# of facilities offering family
    planning services" as the Program Indicators

![](images/image61.png)

In the period tab:

- Select "2016" as the period.

![](images/image202.png)

In the organisation units tab:

- Select "District" as the organisation unit level.

![](images/image2.png)

- Open the layout tab and:

- Move the organisation units down to the Row.
- Move the periods up to the filter.

![](images/image216.png)

- Update to see the table.

Here you will see the output of indicators calculated using the
responses within the SARA survey.

![](images/image204.png)

### Video - Event Data Analysis Demo - Part 2 of 4 (5 min)

Following the previous activity, you’ll see how to use **combined**
**indicators** to perform data analysis. These indicators combine data from
the Tracker model with data from the aggregate model and can be very
powerful in practice to utilize.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE1yjF0Kyj4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DLE1yjF0Kyj4&sa=D&ust=1605599915937000&usg=AOvVaw3KL4VAuaIt_PrySmJO4zcR)

#### Activity 2 - Adding combined indicators

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915938000&usg=AOvVaw1DEVJIp6ad3fkE_UL4rNFe),
use the Pivot Table app to review combined indicators.

In the data tab:

- Add the following to your previous selection:

- "Indicators" as the data type.
- "SARA" as the indicator group.
- "Facility offering ANC rate (%)" and "Facility offer Family Planning
    services rate (%)" as the Indicators.

The data tab should now include the selections from Activity 1 as well
as the new indicators you have now selected.

![](images/image99.png)

- Open the table options and:

- De-select "Show column totals" and "Show row totals".
- Select "Hide empty rows".

![](images/image253.png)=

- Select "Update" to see the table.

This table includes both the program indicators which were previously
introduced as well as the combined indicators that can combine data from
individual programs with other routine aggregated data.  

![](images/image153.png)

### Video - Event Data Analysis Demo - Part 3 of 4 (5 min)

In this video, you will learn how to analyze data collected via event
and tracker capture within the data visualizer app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBlL8E5rpZ0](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DUBlL8E5rpZ0&sa=D&ust=1605599915939000&usg=AOvVaw06SgT_DYHSY4yYs42eBWa9)

#### Activity 3 - Reviewing program data and aggregated data together

For this activity, use the Data Visualizer app in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915940000&usg=AOvVaw0iJSUpC_ncIxRf3cUtTWVd).

In the data tab:

- Select Indicator as the data type.
- First select "SARA" as the Indicator group and "Facility offering
    ANC rate (%)" as the Indicator.
- Then select "ANC" as the Indicator group and "ANC 4th visit coverage
    (%)" as the Indicator.

![](images/image101.png)

In the period tab:

- Select "2016" as the period.

![](images/image15.png)

In the organisation units tab:

- Select "District" as the organisation unit level.

![](images/image2.png)

- Open the layout tab and:

- Move the organisation units down to the Category; the Periods will
    automatically be moved to the filter

![](images/image25.png)

- Click on "Update" to see the output.

In this chart, we have a combined indicator (Facility offering ANC rate
(%)) which takes data from the SARA survey and compares it with an
indicator calculated using aggregate data (ANC 4th visit coverage (%)).
It is possible to perform analysis on data collected via aggregate,
event or tracker processes using the concepts of program and combined
indicators within the Pivot Table, Data Visualizer and GIS (Maps) apps.

later and resume the attempt.

#### Session Quiz - Introduction to Tracker

1. Tracker is meant to: (select one)

- Replace existing electronic medical records (EMR)
- **Bridge the gap between the existing aggregated data and individual-level (tracker) or anonymous event based data**
- Only be used for tracking patients receiving health services

EXPLANATION

Tracker programs can be used outside of the health system, and are not
meant to necessarily replace an EMR. This was discussed in the tracker
intro presentation.

2. What is one of the key differences between event and tracker
    programs? (select one)

- **In tracker programs details are registered in order to follow an entity. Event programs do not include this registration**
- In event programs details are registered in order to follow an
    entity. Tracker programs do not include this registration
- Event programs are more a more advanced version of collection
    individual data when compared to tracker programs

EXPLANATION

Tracker programs involve a key component of registration whereas event
programs are anonymous in nature. This was discussed in the tracker
intro presentation.

3. In event capture we can:

- **Add in validation rules/warnings**
- **Add in indicators that calculate on-the-fly**
- **Enter data offline**

EXPLANATION

All of these functions work in event capture. This was demoed during the
event capture session.

4. When we enter data in event/tracker capture, we must choose a
    predefined period such as weekly, monthly, etc. before entering
    data.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

Event and Tracker capture focus on the collection of individual-level
data. If we think about a survey like SARA, or a health service like
Antenatal care, we will have the individual date when a survey is
performed or that a service is provided. Event and Tracker capture allow
you to select an actual date when entering data rather than a predefined
period. This data can be summarized using any predefined period when
creating analysis outputs as required.

5. Which of the following statement(s) regarding tracker are NOT true:
    (select one or more)

- **Tracker and event data cannot be aggregated**
- **Tracker and event data cannot be compared with aggregated data together**
- Tracker and event capture can be audited to see what changes have
    been made to the data

EXPLANATION

Tracker and event data can be aggregated and analyzed in the analysis
apps. They can also be analyzed together with routine aggregate data.
This was shown during the event analysis session.

6. An entity (person, etc.) can only be registered in one tracker
    program at a time

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

A person can be registered in multiple tracker programs if required.

7. In tracker capture, we can add in relationships, such as
    mother-child, brother-sister, etc.

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Relationships between various entities can be added using tracker
capture.

8. In event capture, if someone comes back to the clinic with malaria
    more than once I can easily find their record again in DHIS2

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

Event programs are isolated events. As there is no registration
component, it would be very difficult to link these events as you would
manually have to find the last time they received treatment.

9. We can analyze combined indicators that use any combination of data
    from event, tracker or routine aggregated data entry

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

We can use combined indicators to combine any of the data types used
within DHIS2. This was shown during the event analysis session.
