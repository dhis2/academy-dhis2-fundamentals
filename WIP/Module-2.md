## 2.0 Overview of the module (10 min)

### What is in this module

What is DHIS2 and where does it come from? What are its **main features**?
What are its **3 building blocks**?

In this module, you will learn how DHIS2, as an open-source management
information platform, is used in countries around the world for
**reporting, analysis, and dissemination of data**.

You will also start to get familiar with the main features of DHIS2 and
its 3 building blocks.

In section 2.2, you will be prompted to **create an account on
Trainingland**, the training environment that we will be using along the
course, which allows you to navigate DHIS2 and get hands-on experience
with it.

After each video, you'll find some **non-graded questions** that will help
you check your knowledge.

At the end of the module, you will find the **first graded quiz** of the
course, which counts for 5% of your final score.

We estimate that you will take about 1 hour to view all the videos and
complete all the learning activities, including the graded assignment.

## 2.1 Introduction to DHIS2/History (10 min)

The **D**istrict **H**ealth **I**nformation **S**oftware - **DHIS2** - it's not only an
open-source platform for reporting, analysis, and dissemination of data
but an initiative supported by a **global network** called the **H**ealth
**I**nformation **S**ystem **P**rogramme or **HISP** and a growing community of users
from more than 60 countries globally.

In this video, you will learn about DHIS2 history,  the network of
action, its main features, and an overview of how it can be used in the
public health context.

    data sources in one location

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can combine data from multiple data sources. This includes through
routine data that is directly collected within the system you are
working as well as supplementary data from other sources such as
surveys.

2. The HISP network works collaboratively on advancing the features
    which DHIS2 supports

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

The HISP network is a world-wide collaboration that supports the
development of the DHIS2 project. Collaboration between the nodes is a
key area of interest to ensure that DHIS2 continues to meet local needs
as defined by its users.

## 2.2 Introduction to Trainingland (10 min)

### Video - Introduction to Trainingland

How are you going to learn to use DHIS2? We believe that the best
approach to learn a new tool is by using it through hands-on activities
in a safe environment.

That is why we created Trainingland, a DHIS2 training environment that
represents a fictional country where you will find all you need to work
with DHIS2 features and become familiar with the capabilities we will
discuss in this course. Watch the following video to get an overview of
Trainingland, and the next steps you need to take to start practicing
with it.

## 2.3 The 1000 Most Vulnerable Days’ Use Case (7 min)

### Video - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

To better understand how DHIS2 can help us to collect, aggregate, and
analyze data in a public health context, we are going to use the example
of the 1000 **M**ost **V**ulnerable **D**ays (MVD’s) use case, which is aimed at
preventing childhood deaths by making informed decisions.

This use case will allow you to see how using DHIS2 will help you to
**track different health programs** for mothers and children, the **health
services** they receive, and see how the collected data inform **their
progress**.

In this video, you will start to get familiar with this use case, which
we'll use throughout the course.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z7J4MhfMQ4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D4Z7J4MhfMQ4&sa=D&ust=1605599915711000&usg=AOvVaw1y4_ypzTvEnWA09xP7DdEt)

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - The 1000 MVD's Use Case

1. The 1000 most vulnerable days use case covers:

- From the time the child is born up until 3 years of age
- **From the time the child is conceived up until 2 years of age -
    correct**
- From the time a mother receives antenatal care and completes her
    post-natal care

EXPLANATION

The 1000 most vulnerable days covers both infant and mother from the
time from when the child was conceived to the child’s 2nd birthday. This
is a critical time for child development; the right nutrition for the
mother and for the child during this time can have a profound impact on
the child's growth and development and reduce disease risk, as well as
protect the mother's health. Elements linked to this use case are used
throughout this academy.

2. This use case is used to help us define: (select one or more)

- **The services that are provided to the mother and child**
- **The data we collect in relation to those services**
- **The outputs we create in relation to those services**

EXPLANATION

All 3 of these items are used to translate elements of the use-case (in
this case, a health-related use case) over to DHIS2. It is important to
identify what the key inputs and outputs are; this is often best
accomplished by understanding the use-case in detail.

## 2.4 Overview of DHIS2 (15 min)

### Video - Overview of DHIS2

In this overview, you will begin to familiarize yourself with some of
the key elements of DHIS2 that we will delve into throughout the course.

First, you will see options that allow you to **customize** your experience
with the platform.

Through examples, you will see the **different types of data** (numerical,
anonymous, or individual data) that can be collected, and the **reports**
that can be obtained.

Lastly, you will begin to hear about the 3 applications that we will see
in detail later on: **Pivot Tables** (used to create dynamic tables), **Data
Visualizer** (used to make charts) and **GIS** (use to make maps) based on the
data stored in the platform.

Note: GIS is currently called Maps starting with DHIS2 version 2.29

#### Knowledge check (not graded) - Overview of DHIS2

1. We can collect different types of data directly within DHIS2 (for
    example, aggregate data or anonymous individual-level data)

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

DHIS2 can collect different types of data directly within the
application. This includes aggregate data, event data (anonymous,
individual level data) and “Tracker” data (identifiable, individual
level data).

2. We can configure data quality checks by creating user-defined
    validation rules which check the data that is entered

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Mathematical rules, referred to as validation rules, can be defined by a
user in order to check the data that is being entered. This is one of
electronic methods checking data quality in DHIS2 and will be discussed
further in other sessions.

3. We can define the variables that we are collecting directly through
    the DHIS2 user-interface

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

As mentioned in the demo, it is a key principle of DHIS2 to allow the
user to customize what they are collecting directly through the
user-interface.

4. The outputs we create can not be given additional
    descriptions/interpretations directly within DHIS2

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

We can provide all of our outputs with additional descriptions and
discuss interpretations directly within DHIS2. This allows us to give
the item more context for when other users are reviewing the information
and will be discussed further in the analysis sessions.

5. The analyses/outputs that we create can not be shared with other
    users directly within DHIS2

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

The analyses/outputs that are created can be shared with other users
directly within DHIS2. This will be discussed more in later sessions.

## 2.5 DHIS2 Building Blocks (7 min)

### Video - DHIS2 Building Blocks

All data that is recorded in DHIS2 has at least **3 dimensions** that
describe it: _where_, which represents the geographic context and is
called the "**organisational unit**"; _what_, that is, what is the raw data
that we are collecting and is called "**data element**"; and _when_, that is,
the "**period**" in which the data is collected.

These are the building blocks of the DHIS2 data model, and are key to
understanding how the platform works.

Data Elements refers to what we are collecting Periods refers to when we
are collecting that information

2. Organisation Units represent (select one):

- **The geographical location of the data**
- Calculated data values
- Health program projects

EXPLANATION

In the core concepts presentation, organisation units are referred to as
the geographical location of the data

3. In DHIS2, data elements and indicators represent the same concept.

- True
- **False**

EXPLANATION

In the building blocks presentation, it is noted that data elements and
indicators represent different concepts. Data elements are the raw data,
while indicators are calculated values.

4. Which of the following are data elements?  (select one or more)

- **Number of maternal deaths**
- Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000)
- **Number of positive malaria cases**
- Annual Malaria Parasite Incidence

EXPLANATION

The data elements are the raw data values that we collect. Calculated
values such as ratios and incidences are considered indicators.
