# Module 3 - Introduction to DHIS2 Analysis (8 hr)

## 3.0 Overview of the module (10 min)

### What is in this module

In the previous module, you learned that DHIS2 is used in public health
for the reporting, analysis, and dissemination of data.

In this module, we’ll delve into the **analysis** function, understanding
the **mechanics** of how to use the following DHIS2 applications: **Pivot
table, Data visualizer, GIS** (now named Maps) and **Reports**.

By watching demonstrations, you’ll see how it’s possible to **combine
tables, charts and maps** to create **integrated analysis**, how to create and
share **dashboards**, how to **interact** with other DHIS2 members through the
platform, and what are the main DHIS2 roles within a system.

After the demonstration videos, you will be prompted to replicate some
of the steps on your own in Trainingland. This will help you become
familiarized with the different apps and the navigation options of each
one of them.

At the end of each subsection, you will find the **graded activities** of
the module: in subsections **3.2, 3.3,** and **3.4**, you will find **assignments**
and **quizzes**, while in subsections **3.5** and **3.6** you will find
only **quizzes**. All graded activities of this module together are worth
**37%**  of your final grade.

We estimate that you will take about 8 -10 hours to view all the videos
and complete all the learning activities, including the graded ones.

## 3.1 Data Analysis Overview Intro  (1,5 min)

*Brief Note: In this table, there should not be more Malaria RDT
positives then Malaria RDT performed. If this is occurring, then there
is likely some issue with the quality of the data. For example, in
Afghan Dispensary for the period Oct - Dec 2015 in both the < 5 and >=
5 age group, we can see that there are more Malaria RDT positives then
Malaria RDT performed. Malaria RDT positives are a direct result of
performing an RDT test to detect malaria, and therefore the number of
Malaria RDT performed should always be >= the number of Malaria RDT
positives.

In this video, we will review how to add thematic layers to our map.
Thematic layers are one of the most useful tools when reviewing maps as
they allow us to display different data directly on the map. Pay
attention to the differences between this interface and the one you used
on pivot tables and data visualizer tools when selecting data, periods,
and organisation units.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSYbaqeo-s](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DkjSYbaqeo-s&sa=D&ust=1605599915777000&usg=AOvVaw2s_VZDq0-RFP1pCLTdoIjg)

## 3.5 - Integrated Analysis, Dashboards, Messaging and Sharing (60 min)

### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 1 of 5 (7 min)

Now that we have reviewed each of the core analysis apps individually,
we can discuss how they can work together in order to produce the most
appropriate visual output to display your data.

In this series of videos, you will learn how to quickly move between
each of the analysis tools by taking any of your produced outputs and
modifying them into a chart, map or pivot table on demand. You will also
review how to create a dashboard where you can put together the
different visualizations you have created from  pivot tables, data
visualizer and GIS (Maps). Lastly, you will also learn how to share your
dashboard with other DHIS2 users.

![](images/image6.png)

![](images/image169.png)

### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 3 of 5 (10 min)

It’s time to learn how to create a dashboard.

In this video, you will find all the steps you need to bring together
the different outputs you have created before (and saved as favorites)
using the data analysis tools (pivot tables, data visualizer, GIS) into
one dashboard. You will also see how to share your dashboard with other
users or groups of users.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_TsUN4JRfE](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dm_TsUN4JRfE&sa=D&ust=1605599915805000&usg=AOvVaw0YzxJfyz-4Y4U0p4lnU2aw)

#### Activity 3 - Dashboards

Create a dashboard in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915806000&usg=AOvVaw18qAO5JpcwqwiaxEks00YU).
In order to add items to a dashboard, you will first have to create a
dashboard.

- Do this by clicking on the "Add" button.

![](images/image92.png)

A pop-up will appear in which you can provide the dashboard with a name.

- Click on "Create" when you have finished creating the dashboard.

![](images/image241.png)

To add items to the dashboard, use the search box located at the top. To
add an item click on the "Add" button next to the favorite. If you click
on the favorite name, it will take you directly to the favorite within
the app it was created rather than adding it to the dashboard.

![](images/image24.png)

- Add the following items to the dashboard (these are all taken from
    your previous exercises on data analysis):

- ANC 1st and 4th (by ANC1) Coverage, Trainingland, Jan 2015 - Dec
    2016 (Chart).
- Outpatient Attendance per 1,000 population, Trainingland, 2016
    (Chart).
- Delivery in Facility, Trainingland Districts, Last 4 Quarters (Pivot
    Table).
- Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery, Delivery in Facility and
    Breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery (%), Trainingland
    Districts, July - December 2016 (Pivot Table).

![](images/image20.png)

![](images/image221.png)

![](images/image237.png)

You can move the items around and resize them to your liking in order to
get a feel for how the objects on the dashboard work. This is a very
useful tool for bringing together multiple analysis in a particular
thematic area together in order to be reviewed quickly. It is
particularly useful for program managers to receive at-a-glance
information regarding the programs they are responsible for.

### Video - Integrated Analysis, ... Demo - Part 4 of 5 (10 min)

1. I have created a pivot table with the following dimensions:

- Data Element Group: Delivery

- Data Element: Births, Live

- Period: Last 4 Quarters

- Organisation Units: Trainingland Districts

In a real-life setting, a username will likely not be used to identify a
favorite.

Which of the following is a good name for the favorite? (select one)

- Live Births
- Deliveries in Trainingland, last 4 Quarters
- Live Births by Trainingland Districts, last 4 Quarters
- **Delivery_Live Births, Districts, last 4 Quarters**

EXPLANATION

The naming convention for favorites should include the program name and
the 3 core dimensions (what you are measuring, where it is coming from
and when it is coming from). This option includes all of these aspects.

2. I want to do some analysis comparing all of the following:

- All Facilities within my organisation unit hierarchy

- The last 12 months worth of data

- A combination of two data elements and one indicator

Which tool(s) should I use to display this information? (select one or
more)

- This type of analysis is not possible in DHIS2
- Data Visualizer
- **Pivot Table**
- GIS

The pivot table application is most suitable when you want to analyze
multiple dimensions of data, including multiple organisation units, time
periods and data types.

3. In DHIS2, I can add additional dimensions (such as Male/Female,
    Public/Private Facilities, etc.) to further break-down my data
    during analysis.

- **True**
- False

EXPLANATION

Data can be broken down into different disaggregations in analysis. This
is shown in both the pivot table and data visualizer demonstrations.

4. If today's date is April 2, 2017 and I select a relative period of
    the last 5 years, which periods will be selected? (select one)

- 2011-2016
- **2012-2016**
- 2013-2017

EXPLANATION

Relative periods work backwards from the current date. In 2017, if we go
back 5 years we have 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

5. Using the features in DHIS2 I can: (select one or more)

- **Move analysis seamlessly between pivot tables, charts and maps**

applications, save outputs and add in descriptions and discuss
interpretations directly within DHIS2.

6. Favorites can be shared: (select one or more)

- **Using specific privileges for each item (such as edit/view)**
- **With other users within DHIS2**
- Directly from DHIS2 to social media

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as
well as sharing sessions. This allows us to specify exactly who sees the
outputs we have created.

7. With the DHIS2 dashboards you can: (select one)

- Have multiple dashboards
- Add favorites from analysis app
- Share dashboards with groups of users

- Make data easily accessible
- Make data easily communicable
- Aid in decision making
- Easily view data from multiple angles in one place
- **All of the above**

EXPLANATION

Dashboards are useful in conveying a variety of different information
together. This was demonstrated during the dashboard demo.

9. Sharing in DHIS2: (select one)

- Is used to define which favorites can be seen by whom
- Can be used to share dashboards with other users
- Can be used to share interpretations with other users
- **All of the above**

EXPLANATION

Sharing can be used to customize the different outputs that can be seen
by each user. This was best demonstrated during the sharing session.

10. Sharing is typically controlled by: (select one)

- Selecting specific users in which to share objects
- **Selecting user groups in which to share objects**
- Sending items through messaging within DHIS2
- All of the above

EXPLANATION

Sharing of favorites was demonstrated in both the integrated analysis as

## 3.6 - Reports App and Reporting Rates (35 min)

### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 1 of 4 (9 min)

In this series of videos, you will learn how to use the reports app,
which contains a series of various reports that allow you to review
information about your system in unique formats when compared to the 3
core analysis apps (pivot table, data visualizer, GIS). In the first
video, you will learn about data set reports and resources within the
reports app.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyAfzvYpOBk](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWyAfzvYpOBk&sa=D&ust=1605599915817000&usg=AOvVaw1sjHXfmHA2FB_0h1x7ThSS)

#### Activity 1 - Data Set Reports and Resources

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915818000&usg=AOvVaw2wqQegU3KuFZuclRsSPP9_), please run a data set report. In order to access data set reports:

- Go to Apps -> Reports -> Data Set Report

![](images/image255.png)

- Select the criteria for the data set report and click on "Get
    report" when ready. You can use the following as a guide:

- Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
- Period Type: Yearly
- Period: 2016
- Organisation Unit: Animal Region (you can try any org unit you like
    here)

![](images/image224.png)

- You will see the results for the dataset/period/organisation unit
    combination after you click on "Get report".

As discussed in the video, this gives you a layout of the data set as
you would see it in data entry. You can not edit the data here however,
and this can often serve as an ideal location to review the data in a
format that users are familiar with. The data can be aggregated within
this report, and therefore looked at within different levels of the
hierarchy as required.

![](images/image45.png)

- Access the resources by using the left-side sub-menu.

![](images/image74.png)

- You can view a resource by left-clicking on the item and selecting
    "View resource".

![](images/image145.png)

### Video - Reports App and Reporting Rates - Part 2 of 4 (5 min)

Next, you will learn how to use the **Organisation Unit Report**. You will
also learn how to use the **Reporting Rate Summary**.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8k-YDtHUIo](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Ds8k-YDtHUIo&sa=D&ust=1605599915819000&usg=AOvVaw1C8c81-wnGXrhRQfnbck_q)

#### Activity 2 - Organisation Unit Reports & Reporting Rate Summary

Organisation unit reports

Once in [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915820000&usg=AOvVaw1mRUM8RaL6asmN5CEdrmRJ), you can access the organisation unit reports:

- By either selecting it from the side-menu within the reports app.

![](images/image158.png)

- Or by going to Apps -> Reports -> Organisation Unit Distribution
    Report.

![](images/image65.png)

In order to run the report:

- Define the criteria that you want to review first. In this example
    we can use the following:

- Report organisation unit: Food Region
- Group Set: Type

- Select "Get report", in order to run the organisation unit report.

![](images/image157.png)

The report will run and break down the facilities by their Type.

![](images/image167.png)

Reporting rate summary

Next we can run the reporting rate summary. We can access this:

- By either selecting it from the side-menu within the reports app.

![](images/image248.png)

- Or by going to Apps -> Reports -> Reporting Rate Summary.

![](images/image232.png)

- Select the criteria to run the report. In this example we can use

- Organisation Unit: Food Region
- Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
- Period Type: Quarterly
- Period: October- December 2016

- Leave "Based on complete data set registrations" selected. This
    means that the completeness is calculated based on the user
    submitting a completed data set within the data entry app. This will
    be discussed more in later sessions.

![](images/image194.png)

- Click on "Get report" in order to run the report and see the
    results.

![](images/image78.png)

### Video - Reports and Reporting Rates - Part 3 of 4 (7 min)

In this video, you will learn how to view reporting rates directly in
the pivot tables app. Reporting Rates are readily available within the
reports app, but you can also use the pivot tables app to review
reporting rates in DHIS2. This gives us the advantage of being able to
review multiple levels of organisation unit reporting rates in one
place.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfCMVvlR3Q](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DVMfCMVvlR3Q&sa=D&ust=1605599915822000&usg=AOvVaw1Zp3WZkYpl5kEjFbuIlK_r)

#### Activity 3 - Reporting Rates in Pivot Tables

In [TRAININGLAND](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action&sa=D&ust=1605599915823000&usg=AOvVaw2uEMtX1Y1SngHjCLQPLhfx), view the reporting rates within the pivot tables application. We will
select all of the metrics associated with the "Primary Health Care
Monthly Data Set".

- In the data tab select:

- "Data Sets" as the data type
- Select the various metrics followed by "Primary Health Care Monthly"
    as related to that metric. For example, select the "Reporting Rates"
    metric type followed by the "Primary Health Care Monthly (Reporting
    rates)" metric. Repeat this for all metric types

- Arrange the metrics you’ve selected according to the order you want
    them displayed within the pivot table.

![](images/image43.png)

- In the period tab select "Last year" as the period. The last year
    that is displayed will be different than what is shown in the video.

![](images/image217.png)

- In the organisation units tab select "Food Region" as the
    organisation unit and "Facility" as the organisation unit level.

![](images/image19.png)

- Alter the table layout so that the organisation units are displayed
    (ensure the organisation unit is not in the filter).

![](images/image219.png)

You can also open the table options and deselect "Show row totals" in
order to remove a nonsensical total in this case.

![](images/image116.png)

- Click on "Update" in order to see the output. Now you will see a
    much longer list of facilities within DHIS2. This image is only
    showing the top portion of the actual output.

![](images/image1.png)

You can view the same metrics in the Data Visualizer App, as you can see
in the Pivot Table app; while the GIS app will allow you to map the
Reporting Rate metric.

#### Questions

1. What does the data set report allow you to do? (select one)

- Review data as it would appear in data entry and allow you to
    update/edit the data
- **Review data as it would appear in data entry without allowing you to
    modify it**
- Output the data as a user-defined one-click report

EXPLANATION

Data set reports were highlighted during the reports app demo. It is
always a good idea to review data in the data set report rather than
data entry as you cannot modify data in this report.

2. Resources in DHIS2 can be used to: (select one or more)

- **Upload items such as data collection forms, guidelines or annual
    reports**
- **Add links to useful websites**
- Add additional assets that will increase DHIS2's performance

EXPLANATION

Resources were demonstrated in the reports app demo. Resources can be
useful for uploading external documentation and links to external
resources amongst other things. In this case, resources do not
correspond with additional resources to power the DHIS2 system.

3. Organisation unit distribution reports can be used to: (select one
    or more)

- **Provide a total count of organisation units that appear at certain
    levels within the hierarchy**
- **Display organisation units based on the groups they belong to**
- Show the geographic distribution of organisation units on a map

EXPLANATION

The organisation unit distribution report was demonstrated in the
reports app demo. This allows us to separate our organisation units into
user defined categories/groups as well as see the number of organisation
units at different levels of the hierarchy.

4. In DHIS2, the reporting rate completeness can be checked in: (select
    one or more)

- **The reports app by running the reporting rate summary**
- **Pivot Table, by selecting the Data Set you are interested in**
