<h3>Assignment 4.3.3</h3>
<p>Create two organisation unit group sets and assign them the appropriate organisation unit groups:</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;<strong>Make sure to add a prefix using your initials to these names (ie. SND_Type, SND_Ownership) when you create them in DHIS2. As everyone is creating items in the same system, you need to provide the group sets with unique names.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Ownership</li>
</ul>
