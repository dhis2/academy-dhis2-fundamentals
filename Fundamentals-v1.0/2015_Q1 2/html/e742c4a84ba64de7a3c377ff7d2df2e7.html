<h3>Assignment 4.6.1 - Create a default data set</h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Using the data elements you have already created in the data element exercise, recreate this data set as a monthly data set collected at the facility level (assign the data set to the facilities you have created). Note that the Data set has already been created for you when you created your account. You can edit it and provide it with a better name if desired. You will need to edit the data sets properties, add the data elements that you have created to this data set and assign it to an organisation unit. This is to get around the issue of managing user privileges that was discussed in the video demonstration, as this data set is by default assigned to your user.&nbsp;</p>
