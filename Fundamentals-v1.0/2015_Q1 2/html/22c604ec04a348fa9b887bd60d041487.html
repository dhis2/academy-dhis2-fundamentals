<h2>NOTE: These graded assignments belong to a series that goes throughout module 4.</h2>
<p>This series of assignments consist of 3 sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set 1: Organisation Units</li>
<li>Set 2: Data Elements</li>
<li><strong>Set 3: Data Sets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This series will allow you to build bits by bits a data set and populate it.</p>
<p>At the end of the last assignment (assignment 4.6.2) you will be ask to check whether you have completed the whole series or not. This check will allow the course team members to validate&nbsp;the result of your&nbsp;assignments&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em;">in DHIS2 Customization</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">. It is only after this validation process that the final grade of this series of assignment will be confirmed. As for the other assignments, you are allowed 3 attempts.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 1em;">Note: Before the validation from the course team, the max grade for this series will be applied, but this grade is not the validated one.</span></em></p>
