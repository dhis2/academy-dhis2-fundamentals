<h1>Discussion forum and support email&nbsp;</h1>
<p>The discussion forums will give you an opportunity to communicate and discuss ideas both with the course staff and with your fellow students. As emphasized, we highly encourage you to participate in these forums to both learn from your peers and discuss course material.</p>
<h2>Support email</h2>
<p>For technical support or when you have issues navigating the platform, we recommend the use of the support email <a href="mailto:fundamentals-support@dhis2.org">fundamentals-support@dhis2.org</a>.</p>
<h2>General Forum Guidelines</h2>
<p>Please post in the correct section. The forum has sections devoted to the various course modules&nbsp;and topics, as well as a dedicated area where you can post any Technical Issues that you may be having.</p>
<p>You can &lsquo;upvote&rsquo; posts. This means that you can give posts more priority by &lsquo;voting&rsquo; for them &lsquo;up&rsquo;. Posts with the most upvotes are likely to get the most attention from the staff and from your fellow students. This process will help both staff and peers to understand what is valued by those participating in the course which may furthermore be used to further tailor the course to your needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be polite to your fellow students. We want to build a positive, encouraging community.</p>
<p>Please search before posting to ensure that your question hasn't already been answered.</p>
<p>Know when to use the &lsquo;report misuse&rsquo; flag. We hope that nobody ever has to use this option, however, if you believe that a post is harassing or wholly inappropriate, you should flag the post using this functionality so the course staff can be aware and take action. The staff will not tolerate harassment of any nature, including, but not limited, to harassment based on race, origin, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation. However, the &lsquo;report misuse&rsquo; flag should not be used simply because you judge a post to be unimportant, incorrect, or poorly thought out.</p>
<p>Apart from the information listed, there are no silly questions and invalid opinions. Please feel free to post anything you feel is relevant in relation to your learning process or that of your peers, and make others feel free to do the same.</p>
