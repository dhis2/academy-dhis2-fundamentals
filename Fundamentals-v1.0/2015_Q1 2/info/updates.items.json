Before we get started, we would like to provide you with some important information.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou will be using this openedX platform to watch the video\u2019s, access readings, solve the challenges and partake in discussions to help you get the most out of the material that is provided. If you have a poor internet connection, please note that video\u2019s, transcripts of the videos and handouts can also be downloaded for studying offline.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are unsure about how to navigate the openedX platform, you may wish to take a short demo course created by openedX to orient learners like you. The demo course can be accessed (<a href=\"http://lms-openedx996141.demo.appsembler.com/courses/course-v1:Appsembler+EdX101+2015_Spring/about\">here</a>). We also have an ongoing discussion, which we will be checking regularly, where you can post any questions or issues you may have with the platform.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will be communicating with you regularly to let you know what we have learned and how we are developing the platform further, highlight your contributions and questions; and keep you updated on any developments in relation to the course that may be of interest for you.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease be sure to take our important pre-course survey. The results are anonymous and will give us a sense of where you are coming from and how we can better ensure the course speaks to your interests.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso, we encourage you to introduce yourself in the discussion forum, and tell us and your fellow students a little bit about yourself, how you are using DHIS2 and what you hope to gain from the course.  Apart from learning from the course material, we hope you will use the forum to learn from each other.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd most importantly, have fun!\n</p>\n<p>\nMatthieu, Hodo and Ellen \n</p>\n",
