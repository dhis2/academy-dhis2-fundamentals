    "here you'll see that the interface for",

    "differences is that at the top we have", 
    "type of chart that we want to create", 
    "within the data visualizer tool we then", 
    "have similar inputs as the pivot table", 
    "this includes our data periods and", 
    "organization units corresponding to our", 
    "what when and where for first example", 
    "let's create a simple bar chart we still", 
    "work with indicators and data elements", 
    "as we have previously and these still", 
    "have groups assigned to them", 
    "let's select ANC first and fourth visit", 
    "for this particular example we can work", 
    "with the periods the same way as we did", 
    "before we still have fixed and relative", 
    "periods", 
    "let's work with a relative . in this", 
    "example organization units are still", 
    "selected as they were before we still", 
    "have the gear icon where we can change", 
    "our selection mode and we still have the", 
    "different organization tree which we can", 
    "expand and collapse for this example", 
    "let's use training land as the", 
    "organization unit once I've selected", 
    "those inputs i can click on update in", 
    "order to update the chart at the bottom", 
    "we have the time periods represented by", 
    "the individual months that have been", 
    "selected the green bar represents the", 
    "ANC first visit while the blue bar", 
    "represents the ANC fourth visit in this", 
    "particular example let's say instead of",

    "training land", 
    "let's change our selection mode select", 
    "levels", 
    "and then select the district if i click", 
    "on update you'll see there is no change", 
    "to the chart itself at the top we can", 
    "see that the district names appear just", 
    "like the PivotTable the chart also has a", 
    "layout that we need to alter in order to", 
    "make sure items are appearing how we", 
    "want them to when we click on layout we", 
    "see that there's a couple new terms that", 
    "we should become familiar with here we", 
    "have the report filter and this is the", 
    "same as in the pivot table where objects", 
    "are filtered out we then have the", 
    "category and the series dimensions", 
    "please refer to the different axes and", 
    "different items on the chart that you", 
    "are creating they're given generic", 
    "terminology because you have different", 
    "chart types", 
    "this includes horizontal bar charts", 
    "spider charts pie charts etc let's", 
    "explain this terminology a little bit", 
    "further", 
    "here is a diagram that represents the", 
    "category and series as applied to a", 
    "horizontal bar chart we can see that the", 
    "category essentially represents the", 
    "x-axes for these types of charts the", 
    "series indicates the individual bars", 
    "that are part of this chart", 
    "let's go back to the previous example we", 
    "made to look at this a bit more here we", 
    "have our periods represented as the", 
    "category you can see that they appear on", 
    "the x-axis the series is represented by", 
    "our data we selected ANC first visit and", 
    "anc fourth visit as the data elements in", 
    "the data tab for this particular chart", 
    "you can see that they are represented as", 
    "different bars on this chart with the", 
    "green bar representing the ANC first", 
    "visit and the blue bar representing the", 
    "ANC fourth visit", 
    "this corresponds to the series as", 
    "defined in our chart Leo if I want the", 
    "organization units to appear in this", 
    "case it is the districts that I've", 
    "selected I can move the organization", 
    "units down from the filter to the", 
    "category i can do this by dragging and", 
    "dropping just like i did in the", 
    "PivotTable application you will see that", 
    "once i move organization units down to", 
    "the category the periods moves up to the", 
    "filter this is because in the data", 
    "visualizer you cannot have multiple", 
    "dimensions represented as your category", 
    "or your series this is one of the key", 
    "features in the pivot table is you could", 
    "have as many dimensions as you like", 
    "represented in your row or column now if", 
    "i update this particular chart i will", 
    "see the organization units represented", 
    "on my x-axis you can see now up at the", 
    "top the periods that have been filtered", 
    "out are now represented let's take a", 
    "look at this data a bit further by", 
    "looking at the facility data for", 
    "training land", 
    "i'm going to select facility and then", 
    "update the chart now you can see that", 
    "this is quite difficult to view we have", 
    "a lot of information here and it's not", 
    "so easy to process and determine what", 
    "this chart is telling us we can make a", 
    "couple changes to this chart in order to", 
    "make it more legible first let's make it", 
    "a bit bigger on our screen we can use", 
    "these triple arrows to collapse the data", 
    "dimension selection you can see now the", 
    "size of the chart is increased now let's", 
    "get rid of a lot of this additional", 
    "information that's making the chart", 
    "difficult to interpret if we click on", 
    "options we can remove a number of these", 
    "items and make this chart easier to read", 
    "first let's remove the values by", 
    "deselecting chill values the next thing", 
    "we can do is hide the empty category", 
    "items", 
    "remember we have the category selected", 
    "as the organization unit it's not going", 
    "to remove the organization units that", 
    "don't have any data in this example we", 
    "can also sort the chart from low to high", 
    "or from high to low", 
    "we can also add titles to the axis as", 
    "well as the chart itself here we have", 
    "some new terms introduced again range", 
    "and domain the reason why some different", 
    "terminology is introduced is because we", 
    "also have vertical and horizontal chart", 
    "types for a horizontal chart the range", 
    "can be thought of as the y axes and the", 
    "domain can be considered the x-axis we", 
    "can also give the chart title at the", 
    "bottom", 
    "let's start by giving the chart title", 
    "we can also give the range and domain a", 
    "title remember the range in this case is", 
    "our y axes and the domain in this case", 
    "is our x-axis once we've made our", 
    "different selections in our options we", 
    "can go ahead and update the chart you", 
    "can see now that this chart is a lot", 
    "easier to interpret we can automatically", 
    "determine which facilities have the most", 
    "ANC visits and conversely which", 
    "facilities have the least number of anc", 
    "visits remember that we've removed any", 
    "facilities that don't have any NC visits", 
    "within the last 12 months for training", 
    "and now we've gone to the trouble of", 
    "customizing this chart a little bit and", 
    "making it easier to read", 
    "we might want to save this as a favorite", 
    "the favorites interface works a little", 
    "bit different in data visualizer when", 
    "compared to pivot table later on these", 
    "will be harmonized and the interface", 
    "will be the same but for now we're going", 
    "to click on favorites and this will open", 
    "up a new menu that lists all the", 
    "favorites that are stored in the system", 
    "in order to add a new favorite i click", 
    "on add new and then give the favorite", 
    "name now remember we're naming the",

    "what",
