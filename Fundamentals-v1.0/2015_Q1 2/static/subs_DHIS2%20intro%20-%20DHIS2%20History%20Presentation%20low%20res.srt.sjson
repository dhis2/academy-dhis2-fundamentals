    "dhis to has also been applied to use",

    "a brief history of dhis to through the", 
    "collaboration between University of", 
    "Basel and the university of western cape", 
    "deh is one was actually created and used", 
    "in south africa in 2006 DHS to was", 
    "piloted this was a shift", 
    "over from an access based system in", 
    "which this1 was using over to the", 
    "web-based platform that we now know", 
    "today in 2012 a series of djs to", 
    "academies were launched allowing for", 
    "regional capacity building by the end of", 
    "2014 46 countries were using dhis to", 
    "this is only grown since then in 2016", 
    "there are 29 countries and seven indian", 
    "states that use dhis to as its national", 
    "standard various partner countries and", 
    "other agencies are also using dhis to in", 
    "various stages of implementation the", 
    "hosp collaboration has resulted in the", 
    "creation of a global dhis to network of", 
    "action", 
    "this includes open-source development", 
    "through various hosp notes as well as", 
    "hosp nose being created in multiple", 
    "countries lately we also see", 
    "collaborations between countries that",

    "level use cases in these cases we have", 
    "countries sharing data together using", 
    "dhis to and allowing individuals to",

    "workshops allow for individuals to come",

    "we've recently introduced a new",

    "we will go over this in more detail in", 
    "other sessions the level one academy", 
    "includes the information use",

    "functionalities customizations advanced", 
    "use cases", 
    "one of the concepts that we will come", 
    "back to in other sessions is ID is too", 
    "is a platform it's a generic platform", 
    "that therefore supports a wide range of", 
    "different use cases both within and", 
    "outside of the health sector",

    "development so some considerations do", 
    "need to be made when adopting dhis to", 
    "DHS to is a platform it's not a one-off", 
    "or off-the-shelf product it's highly",
