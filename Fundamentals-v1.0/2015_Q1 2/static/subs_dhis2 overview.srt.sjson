    "features that allow us to customize the", 
    "experience a little bit if i go over the", 
    "initials in the corner here and click on", 
    "settings we can actually offer some of", 
    "the settings for the application this is", 
    "per user", 
    "this includes examples like the", 
    "interface language the database language", 
    "and the style of the application let's", 
    "change the style to see what effect this", 
    "has we also have a tab for user profile", 
    "this allows us to update our own details", 
    "it's always a good idea to fill in the", 
    "profile later on is this facilitates", 
    "communication and follow-up and then the", 
    "last part is the account settings where", 
    "we can of course update or change your", 
    "password i go back to the dashboard we", 
    "can see how the style of facts the", 
    "application in dhis to one of the key", 
    "principles is that all the items that", 
    "are made for either data collection or", 
    "data output should be definable through", 
    "the user interface and eh is to reuse", 
    "the maintenance application to update", 
    "the various items that we are collecting", 
    "for the outputs that we are creating we", 
    "will discuss quite a few of these", 
    "objects that are available in a lot more", 
    "detail in other sessions", 
    "india ties to there are multiple ways to", 
    "collect data there are three broad", 
    "categories of data dhis to can collect", 
    "this includes numerical or aggregated", 
    "data anonymous individualized data as", 
    "well as individual data that has some", 
    "kind of identifiers attached to the data", 
    "let's show you an example of the", 
    "numerical based data entry in the", 
    "numerical base data entry we enter data", 
    "by the structure of the system working", 
    "with this could be a health system or an", 
    "organization depending on how th eyes to", 
    "is being used in this example we have a", 
    "whole system hierarchy built-in to dhis", 
    "to this allows us to select for example", 
    "a facility to enter data into there are", 
    "a number of different reporting forms", 
    "that can be made in dhis to these can be", 
    "simple reporting forms that are", 
    "generated by the system itself but we", 
    "can also create more complex forms that", 
    "more closely reflect paper-based forms", 
    "that are being used in the field we will", 
    "discuss the creation of these datasets", 
    "in a bit of detail later on the next", 
    "type of data that can be entered into", 
    "dhis to his anonymous individual data", 
    "this can be for example something like a", 
    "facility survey or some type of long", 
    "list that doesn't have any identifying", 
    "information attached to it", 
    "in this example we have a survey that's", 
    "being entered by facility we can then", 
    "enter the data for each individual", 
    "facility and then receive the results 3d", 
    "eyes to we can create different", 
    "statistics and outputs based on the data", 
    "that is centered we will discuss this", 
    "method of collecting data a little bit", 
    "more later on plastic data entry is", 
    "individual information that does have", 
    "identifying characteristics", 
    "this means that we can identify the", 
    "person by their name by some type of", 
    "unique identifier the phone number or", 
    "any other", 
    "identifying characteristics attached to", 
    "that particular person", 
    "note that this type of data entry can be", 
    "extended beyond people and beyond the", 
    "house sector but in this example we are", 
    "tracking a person ND tries to you can", 
    "actually register the person in a", 
    "certain program or Justin dhis to itself", 
    "register them in multiple types of", 
    "services and then you can collect", 
    "information related to the services that", 
    "they are receiving in this example or", 
    "register your child to receive their set", 
    "of immunizations you can see that there", 
    "are multiple identifier is available for", 
    "this person including the first and last", 
    "name the child number and their mothers", 
    "first and last name", 
    "these can all be used to help in", 
    "identifying the child they will then be", 
    "tracked through their set of", 
    "immunization services later on we will", 
    "go through an example where we register", 
    "a person and tracking through the", 
    "various services that they receive once", 
    "we've entered all our data into dhis to", 
    "there are a couple different methods", 
    "which we can use to check on the quality", 
    "of the data one of these methods is to", 
    "check on mathematical rules that we", 
    "build into dhis to this ensures that the", 
    "data meet certain criteria when it", 
    "entered into the system we can run this", 
    "type of analysis all at once", 
    "we can see that when we run this type of", 
    "analysis it brings up any issues with", 
    "the data quality based on these rules", 
    "that we've created we will discuss this", 
    "in a bit more detail in later sessions", 
    "india ties to we can also create", 
    "standard type reports that are based off", 
    "different organizational or ministry", 
    "templates one of these tools is called a", 
    "standard report using these types of", 
    "standard reports you can make your own", 
    "customized outputs within DHS to we", 
    "won't discuss how to create these during", 
    "the fundamental level course it's", 
    "important to note that these types of", 
    "reports are possible we can also run", 
    "data approval", 
    "this is the process of approving data", 
    "within DHS to we can use data approval", 
    "to approve data at any level within the", 
    "organization that you're working with", 
    "this allows us to review the data", 
    "electronically and then electronically", 
    "approve this data as well once we run", 
    "some checks on our data to ensure that", 
    "its quality we can go ahead and create", 
    "some outputs in DHS too", 
    "there are several tools available in", 
    "order to create these outputs the ones", 
    "we will be focusing on the pivot table", 
    "data visualizer and GIS these allow us", 
    "to make tables charts and maps", 
    "respectively these types of outputs can", 
    "be generated very quickly by DHS to as", 
    "long as we have data entered into the", 
    "system", 
    "here's an example of a pivot table we", 
    "can see how quickly it appears this is", 
    "of course an example of a previous table", 
    "that's already been created but we will", 
    "go over the ins and outs of creating", 
    "these tables within DHS to DJ is to also", 
    "supports the creation of different chart", 
    "types once again all these charts are", 
    "based on the data that's entered into", 
    "dhis to lastly we have maps", 
    "there are quite a few different features", 
    "available in the GIS application within", 
    "dhis we will discuss them in more detail", 
    "later on but you can see here that we", 
    "can create different outputs based on", 
    "the data that centered just like four", 
    "charts and tables", 
    "one of the interesting features in dhis", 
    "that allows you to extend the usability", 
    "of these different analysis items that", 
    "we can add descriptions and", 
    "interpretations", 
    "this allows you to provide a bit more", 
    "context to the data that you're", 
    "displaying you can also share these", 
    "analyses with other users in order to", 
    "share what you found and start a", 
    "discussion he tries to also have some in", 
    "build tools in order to facilitate more", 
    "private discussion and he tries to you", 
    "can write messages and write feedback", 
    "DJ is too has an internal messaging", 
    "application that allows you to message", 
    "other users in the system there is also", 
    "a feedback system feedback system within", 
    "DHS to allow those users who are", 
    "managing the system to prioritize this", 
    "feedback and respond to is necessary", 
    "they can also have internal discussions", 
    "about the problems and try to solve them", 
    "before returning the response back to", 
    "the user", 
    "we will discuss this feature in more", 
    "detail later on", 
    "now everything that's created in DHS to", 
    "can actually be shared with other users", 
    "so we can decide actually who share our", 
    "different analyses with we will discuss", 
    "how to do this a little bit more later", 
    "on that has been a very quick overview", 
    "of dhis to we will start going over", 
    "these features in a little bit more", 
    "detail in the following sections"
